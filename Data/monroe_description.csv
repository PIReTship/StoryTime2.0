Harry was forced to live a horrid life there where he was locked up in a small storage room under the stair well eating very little and becoming very thin. He didn't even know that the wizarding world existed, or that that is where he belonged. He wondered if he was ever going to escape his horrible life there, with the Dursleys.
      Harry thought he was stuck with them for good until Uncle Vernon decided the were going away. Where Uncle Vernon was going to drive them, no one knew. All that Harry was sure of, is that he was locked up in the car, in the middle of nowhere, with a crying, screaming Dudley. Life was miserable.
     That night, Harry was greeted by a giant named Hagrid. Harry was informed of his historic past and invited to Hogwarts, a school of witchcraft and wizardry. There, he had some of the bast days of his life. 

Here is what took place:

- Harry was sorted into the Gryfinndor House and had a funny encounter with the Sorting Hat on the way.
- Harry joined the Gryfinndor Quidditch team. There he made history for being the youngest player in the history of Hogwarts, being only a first year.
- Harry made friends with Hermione and Ron.
- Harry was swarmed around by so many students and even teachers.
- Harry helped Hagrid illegally hatch a baby Norwegian Ridgeback. In the process of receiving the baby dragon,  Hagrid accidentally spilled the beans on some very important information to the person he got the baby dragon from. This person turned out to be Harry Potter's biggest enemy. Hagrid's mishap almost cost Harry his life.

helping a spirit at her school cross over successfully. The question is can
she do it without needing to switch schools herself? In this the first of

using teenage models, they had no idea the technology might backfire. But
backfire it did: some nights when the kids go to sleep, they wake up in one
of the Disney parks as a hologram. With the adventures in the first books
now resolved, Kingdom Keepers III: Disney in Shadow follows the five
teens—Finn, Philby, Willa, Charlene, and Maybeck—as they search to find
Wayne, their mentor and head Imagineer, who has mysteriously gone missing.
Concerned that Wayne has been abducted by the Overtakers—Disney villains,
who along with other Disney characters, take over the parks when the
turnstiles stop spinning and who want desperately to steer the parks to a
far darker place—the five kids pick up a major clue from their close friend
whose dreams (nightmares, really) often accurately predict the future.
Clues from a dream lead the kids into Disney’s Hollywood Studios and Epcot.
Each clue seems tied to the last, and with the stakes growing ever higher,
what starts out as a puzzle ends up as a fight for survival. A transparent
paper box, a quest for a sword, rides on Soarin’ and Maelstrom, life-and-
death encounters with a giant snake and a devious Maleficent lead the

The ultimate battle between good and evil that closes out this final chapter of the epic series takes place where Harry's Wizarding life began: at Hogwarts. The satisfying conclusion offers shocking last-minute twists, incredible acts of courage, powerful new forms of magic, and the resolution of many mysteries. Above all, this intense, cathartic book serves as a clear statement of the message at the heart of the Harry Potter series: that choice matters much more than destiny, and that love will always triumph over death. Series Information: Eleven-year-old Harry Potter is an orphan living with his cruel aunt and uncle when he makes a discovery that will change his life forever: he is a wizard. He is whisked away to the mystical Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magical skills, from potions to spells to flying on broomsticks. But an evil power is rising, the same one that threatened to destroy the entire world when Harry was only a baby. As Harry learns the truth about his family, his childhood, and his mysterious lightning-bolt-shaped scar, he finds unforgettable friendship, a loving surrogate family, and the courage to face the darkest force ever to menace the wizarding world. These charming and engrossing books bring an intensely detailed and captivating world to life and are perfect for enjoying individually or reading aloud.",Harry Potter Book 7: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,J.

his evil purpose.",Lord Of The Rings The Return Of The King,J.R.R Tolkien,,"Well this is the third book in the series and the last. (I have written reviews on the other two.)
Now they are nearing mount doom and its getting to the good parts. Now there is a very large party of Uruk-hai (A larger species of orc.) Now they are coming to attack this keep and the Uruk-hai are well armored and Gollum/Smeagol is still annoying and in this book but he is a more important character then you would think. Anyways Arogorn and Gimli and Legolas. (Though Gollum, Samwise and Frodo still aren't there.) Now basically The people at the keep are just sort of hoping that Frodo manages too throw the ring into the fires of mount doom. (Since there are no dragons left to melt it using dragon fire anymore. And I'm pretty sure in the Hobbit the last one was killed even though lord of the rings is many years afterwards.) Gandalf is in Rohan and if you read the two towers you know Boramir got killed so we can leave him out of this. Now basically everyone in the keep is getting ready for war, stringing bows, fletching arrows and sharpening swords of the like now the Uruk-hai are all ready in armor and there not like normal orcs they have thick armor and shields and have control over others. Now the story takes off from here Rohan with Gandalf helping the keep and everything else the real war has started and its pretty nasty, and the hobbits back at Frodo's home are having problems too involving people trying to take over there homes and everything.  ",,Well I had already read the Hobbit and the first two books of lord of the rings so I read the second. (May find a little confusing because I wrote it from a Bibliophilia point of view.),I liked it because it was written in a way that no other writer would write it.,Well it seems that all the secrets are being found out in this book of the trilogy and everything so some things are pretty weird and you would not expect them. ,5/5,The Return of the King: Being the Third Part of The Lord of the Rings,10.0,207.0,
