million teens and young adults through his playful, sweet, and
inspirational YouTube presence. Already a bestselling author with his
memoir, In Real Life, Joey now presents his first novel, Children of Eden.
Rowan is a second child in a world where population control measures make
her an outlaw, marked for death. She can never go to school, make friends,
or get the eye implants that will mark her as a true member of Eden.
Indeed, her kaleidoscopic eyes may very well give her away to the ruthless
Center government. Outside of Eden, Earth is poisoned and dead. All animals
and most plants have been destroyed by a man-made catastrophe. Long ago,
the brilliant scientist Aaron Al-Baz saved a pocket of civilization by
designing the EcoPanopticon, a massive computer program that hijacked all
global technology and put it to use preserving the last vestiges of
mankind. Humans will wait for thousands of years in Eden until the EcoPan
heals the world. As an illegal second child, Rowan has been hidden away in
her family’s compound for sixteen years. Now, desperate to see the world,
she recklessly escapes for what she swears will be only one night of
adventure. Though she finds an exotic world, and even a friend, the night
leads to tragedy. Soon Rowan becomes a renegade on the run. The first novel
from YouTube superstar Joey Graceffa, Children of Eden is a thrilling and
completely absorbing new book from one of social media’s brightest young
storytellers.",278,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7878669-L.jpg,"{'Anger': 0.08733337202778262, 'Anticipation': 0.15547429721206493, 'Disgust': 0.05713235436376651, 'Fear': 0.13086462746918953, 'Joy': 0.232147348462863, 'Sadness': 0.09569137307253274, 'Surprise': 0.05939597964671967, 'Trust': 0.18196064774508103}",

Concerned Wayne has been abducted by the Overtakers--Disney villains, who along with other Disney characters, take over the parks when the turnstiles stop spinning, and want desperately to steer the parks to a far darker place--the five kids pick up a major clue from a close friend, Jez, whose dreams (nightmares, really) often accurately predict the future. <br /><br />The very few clues from Jez's dream lead the kids into Disney's Hollywood Studios and Epcot--through imaginary worlds that become real, by imaginary kids who are real. Each clue seems tied to the last, and with the stakes growing ever higher, what starts out as a puzzle ends up as a fight for their lives. Through a transparent paper box, a quest for a sword, rides on Soarin' and Maelstrom, life-and-death encounters with giant snakes, and a devious Maleficent, the Kingdom Keepers not only begin to decipher deeper meanings to the clues, but discover new truths about themselves and their ever-growing friendships.",545,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6426744-L.jpg,"{'Anger': 0.05497831130838293, 'Anticipation': 0.20299942836006593, 'Disgust': 0.022058576280305324, 'Fear': 0.18097447795823668, 'Joy': 0.21624802447963953, 'Sadness': 0.08315679747133395, 'Surprise': 0.031003059954941323, 'Trust': 0.2085813241870944}",

any of us who want a better understanding of Hillary Clinton, this book is
an excellent place to start.” —Bob Schieffer, CBS News As a young girl,
Hillary Diane Rodham’s parents told her she could be whatever she wanted--
as long as she was willing to work for it. Hillary took those words and
ran. In a life on the front row of modern American history, she has always
stood out--whether she was a teen campaigning for the 1964 Republican
presidential candidate, winning recognition in Life magazine for her
pointed words as the first student commencement speaker at Wellesley
College, or working on the Richard Nixon impeachment case as a newly minted
lawyer. For all her accomplishments, scrutiny and scandal have followed
this complex woman since she stepped into the public eye—from her role as
First Lady of Arkansas to First Lady of the United States to becoming the
first female U.S. senator from New York to U.S. secretary of state. Despite
intense criticism, Hillary has remained committed to public service and
dedicated to health-care reform, children's issues, and women’s rights.
Now, she aspires to a bigger role: her nation's first woman president. In
Hillary Rodham Clinton: A Woman Living History, critically acclaimed author
Karen Blumenthal gives us an intimate and unflinching look at the public
and personal life of Hillary Rodham Clinton. Illustrated throughout with
black-and-white photographs and political cartoons, this is a must-have
biography about a woman who has fascinated--and divided--the public, who
continues to push boundaries, and who isn’t afraid to reach for one more
goal. The paperback is revised and updated with chapters about the 2016
presidential campaign and election. Praise for Hillary Rodham Clinton: A
Woman Living History: ""After decades in the public eye, Hillary Rodham
Clinton is still an enigma, as Blumenthal (Tommy: The Gun That Changed
America) emphasizes in this compelling portrait of the former U.S. Senator
and Secretary of State’s journey from budding activist to presidential
aspirant."" —Publishers Weekly, starred review ""Thorough and evenhanded. . .
. Blumenthal, a longtime Wall Street Journal reporter, is part of a current
wave of narrative nonfiction authors who write for teenagers with such
directness and clarity that adult readers, too, may gain a deeper
understanding. . . . Providing nuanced but clear explanations for the ways
Hillary’s personality and personal history have shaped her political career
is where Blumenthal’s method really pays off."" —The New York Times",472,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dpy_jwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"{'Anger': 0.055050933786078095, 'Anticipation': 0.19628607809847198, 'Disgust': 0.027037351443123938, 'Fear': 0.08251273344651952, 'Joy': 0.24571307300509335, 'Sadness': 0.04567062818336163, 'Surprise': 0.048896434634974534, 'Trust': 0.2988327674023769}",

Books of the Year “This gut-wrenching, poetic memoir reminds us that no
life story can be reduced to the word ‘refugee.’"" —New York Times Book
Review “A critical piece of literature, contributing to the larger refugee
narrative in a way that is complex and nuanced.” —School Library Journal
(starred review) This profoundly moving memoir is the remarkable and
inspiring true story of Sandra Uwiringiyimana, a girl from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo who tells the tale of how she survived a massacre,
immigrated to America, and overcame her trauma through art and activism.
Sandra was just ten years old when she found herself with a gun pointed at
her head. She had watched as rebels gunned down her mother and six-year-old
sister in a refugee camp. Remarkably, the rebel didn’t pull the trigger,
and Sandra escaped. Thus began a new life for her and her surviving family
members. With no home and no money, they struggled to stay alive.
Eventually, through a United Nations refugee program, they moved to
America, only to face yet another ethnic disconnect. Sandra may have
crossed an ocean, but there was now a much wider divide she had to
overcome. And it started with middle school in New York. In this memoir,
Sandra tells the story of her survival, of finding her place in a new
country, of her hope for the future, and how she found a way to give voice
to her people.",0,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8185372-L.jpg,"{'Anger': 0.0899108063287168, 'Anticipation': 0.13078750392183228, 'Disgust': 0.036775581551700964, 'Fear': 0.14817802877504374, 'Joy': 0.1985119447806015, 'Sadness': 0.10523956792613508, 'Surprise': 0.04744296535341312, 'Trust': 0.24315360136255665}",
