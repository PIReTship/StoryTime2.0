Fancy Nancy's closet is bulging (that's a fancy way of saying it won't close). Nancy's mom thinks she should give away some of her tutusâ€”but Nancy knows a fancy girl can never have too many tutus! But when Ms. Glass tells her class they will have a fancy swap-and-shop at school, will Nancy bring in some tutus to trade? And what happens when she finds the tutu of her dreams? Fancy Nancy: Too Many Tutus is a Level One I Can Read book, which means it's perfect for children learning to sound out words and sentences. The back matter features a list of the rich vocabulary words that are used throughout the story along with their definition.
