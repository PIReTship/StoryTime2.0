Holm,89377,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320470906m/89377.jpg,Random House Books for Young Readers,"It's 1953 and 11-year-old Penny dreams of a summer of butter pecan ice cream, swimming, and baseball. But nothing's that easy in Penny's family. For starters, she can't go swimming because her mother's afraid she'll catch polio at the pool. To make matters worse, her favorite uncle is living in a car. Her Nonny cries every time her father's name is mentioned. And the two sides of her family aren't speaking to each other!<br /><br />Inspired by Newbery Honor winner Jennifer Holm's own Italian American family, <i>Penny from Heaven </i>is a shining story about the everyday and the extraordinary, about a time in America's history, not all that long ago, when being Italian meant that you were the enemy. But most of all, it's a story about families--about the things that tear them apart and bring them together. And Holm tells it with all the richness and the layers, the love and the laughter of a Sunday dinner at Nonny's. So pull up a chair and enjoy the feast! Buon appetito!",Penny_from_Heaven,"[""When I read the first page of this book I thought, Is this a book about religion? \n It isn't. \n The setting is New Jersey during the 50's where eleven-year-old Penny Falucci, the narrator, spends time with her cousin, Frankie, who usually cooks up an adventure that gets them both into trouble. Her father is dead and no one will talk about it. Her mother doesn't get along with her father's family but she doesn't ban Penny from seeing them every Sunday where Penny goes for dinner. This huge Italian American family is boisterous, eccentric, and loveable. When Penny seriously hurts herself in an accident she finds out the truth about her father and why the two families don't get along. \n This book won a Newbery Honor in 2007. The writing is terrific with great character development. The tension comes from the families not getting along, Penny frustrated with her Mom who is afraid to let her do activities with other kids her age, and Frankie who talks her into sneaking out to places behind her Mom's back. Penny loves baseball and she listens to the Dodgers games with her uncle. Some might find this book slow but I loved it and thought the character development terrific. The action picks up as the plot moves toward the climax of the story. \n Penny suffers a nasty injury in the book and there are some sad parts. Penny also starts to notice boys and thinks about dating. I thought the pacing was good and I found it hard to put down. If you read Countdown by Deborah Wiles, and liked it then you will probably like this book."", ""This is such a cute book. Penny is a young girl in the fifties and this book captured so many elements of that context and that story. Her Italian family was vibrantly painted, her mother and grandparents equally so. This was the story of one summer, but I felt like it's more symbolic of her whole girlhood. So many things happen, but it all feels cohesive because they are so many of those growing-up rites of passage. The author used hundreds of family stories and historical facts to make this book, and the authenticity of her source material really shone through. As a reader, I could tell that she was intimately acquainted with these characters, and that they sort of existed outside just the context of this book. I liked that this was the story of just so many things, that really made it a cross-section of life. It's the story of the fifties, of being Italian American, of having a single working mother, of growing up, of the Italian American experience during World War 2, of luck and fate and hope and believing. One of the things that I noticed was that it was sort of fragmented, the chapters would tell one episode and then move on. I loved this so much because that is the way memories really work. You probably don't remember anything between the time this happened and the time that happened, but they do have a habit of organizing themselves into little narratives. This is a story of growing up, and that story doesn't organize well into some cohesive and straightforward plot, but is many stories all at once. I guess the most prominent idea in my head when I think about this book is how authentic it is. I could relate to the story, and learn from it, and be entertained by it because it is authentic and just very cute."", ""Good book. I like how it was based on a true story - by the author's mother nonetheless. I also can't imagine how it would feel to have your arm sucked through a primitive washing machine. OUCH!!!"", 'This was a good book, normally I read books that have a summary on the back or inside cover, this one didn\'t. Just the lyrics from the song ""Pennies From Heaven"" on the back. So I started reading it and got sucked in, it didn\'t have a plot really, I mean there were little things but no major plot, it was more of just a story about Penny\'s life, and if you think about your own life there\'s no real plot, just things that happen every now and then. \n It has a bittersweet feel after a few chapters. It was kind of hard to read because of that and because I\'m emotional, but it got at my heart and I love that about books, so that\'s why this one got 4 stars. \n I can\'t say I would\'ve liked it had I read it a couple years ago or when I was in middle-school, but I\'m sure there would be plenty of middle-schoolers that would like the normalness, or mostly anyway, to this book, even though it\'s set back in time when polio was a big deal and there were wringers to dry your clothes.', ""I love Jennifer Holm! She is a fantastic author. While this wasn't my favorite book by her, I still really enjoyed it and I learned a good deal about growing up after WWII. Things like the polio scare, where parents would not let their children go swimming in public pools or go to movie theaters b/c they were afraid their child would catch polio. And the prejudice that was alive and well for those who from countries we were at war with in WWII. A sad and shameful part of U.S. history."", 'Me compre este libro en una feria del libro que organizaron en mi colegio cuando tenia once o doce anos y me lo compre porque me llamo la atencion. Recuerdo que me fascino y me gusto muchisimo, tengo un recuerdo precioso de este libro, aunque no recuerdo muy de que iba.', 'Up to 2007....', 'Very sweet story.', ""I had a really hard time getting into this book, so I started it about 4 or 5 different times throughout the year. Once I reached page 40, I was hooked and couldn't put it down! I loved the author's depiction of this Italian family - reminded me of stories my mom and grandmother (Nonna emigrated from Sicily post-WWII) would tell of our Italian family. This was a really heartwarming story of how a broken family continued on in the wake of tragedy and loss. Highly recommend!!"", 'Loved the family album', 'The summer of 1953 holds big changes for Penny. She is turning twelve, has her first job at her uncles store, and learns more about her family and her father who died when she was only an infant. Although I don\'t think this is as strong a piece as ""The Creek"", it was still an enjoyable read. Unnecessary plot developments - a cousins old girlfriend and her new (bad) relationship - hold the story back, but the setting and characters are strong enough to make the story work. I\'m continuing to be amazed at the US History that I\'ve never been taught! Italian American Interment Camps?! Who knew? Holm\'s author\'s note, and family photos are the real gems in this book. Characters come more alive with these little extras - I wish I would have looked at the end first!', ""I love this author- she is amazing at capturing people and relationships and also educating you about a period in history and how life is for common people. \n In this story, set in 1953, Penny, 11, discovers truth about her father's mysterious death after her birth. Mixing her father's loud, open, loving Italian family with her mom's quiet, closed family is quite entertaining too!"", 'I like the way Jennifer Holm\'s writes. The main character in this book, as in Turtle in Paradise has a pure, sincere voice. \n This paragraph reminds me of someone I know... \n ""It\'s not exactly the best day to be painting; it\'s about a hundred degrees out. The whole time we paint, Pop-pop keeps up a running commentary on how I\'m doing everything wrong. \'You\'re using too mucvh paint,\' he\'ll say, or \'Hold the brush this way.\' His favorite is \'Don\'t they teach you anything in that school of yours?\'""', ""I'm usually not a big fan of middle readers, but this one seemed to be more meaty than most. It followed a girl whose father's side of the family was Italian-America during the 1950s. It was intriguing to peek into their culture, and also to finally start to understand why I hear so much prejudice against the Italian-Americans from folks my parents' age and older. At the same time, Pennies From Heaven felt like the stories my father tells me about growing up during the same time period, so the nationality wasn't the only important factor."", ""Sweet little episodic story about a girl pulled between her deceased father's boisterous Italian-American family and her mother's WASP side, and how their love for her brings both sides together in the end."", 'too long too simple to typical', 'I recommend the audio. I enjoyed the reader. This is the first chapter book that I read by Jennifer Holm and I loved it. I really enjoyed all the kookie characters in this story and the wild situations that they get in. I also kept thinking....what happened to her dad and how did he die?! \n My favorite character was Uncle Dominique...such a sweet character and my heart ached for him.', 'Eleven-year-old Penny loves her father\'s Italian family. Even though her father died before she was born, she spends as much time as she can with her loud uncles and aunts. She can\'t understand why her ""plain old American"" mother and grandparents don\'t seem to like them. As she approaches her twelfth-birthday, Penny begins to learn the truth about the relationship between her mother and her father\'s family--and exactly what caused her father\'s mysterious death. \n There are moments when Penny from Heaven truly shines. The love Penny shares with both her families is truly moving. Penny has some startling moments of self-realization. And the characters, from a burping grandfather to a vividly-described Italian nonna, are delightfully three-dimentional. Unfortunately, the book is poorly paced. The beginning of the book is episodic, leading up to a climax for which the reader is completely unprepared, presented in a rushed and confused way. Holm doesn\'t sufficiently tease the reader with the mysterious cause of Penny\'s father\'s death, so the true, historical facts that led up to it don\'t hit home the way they should. While some readers will enjoy the charming, first-person narrative, most members of the intended audience are more likely to be bored than entertained.', ""After reading the first half of the book I was wondering when something interesting/exciting was going to happen. I read a few reviews to see if there was a chance at some kind of plot just to find out that it's more about just normal every day life back in that day. So after accepting it for what it is, I enjoyed it a little more after that. The ending was even rather touching."", ""I was all set to give this book 3 stars but then it surprised me. I didn't realize how much I liked it until I was about halfway into it. Middle school girls who come from big Italian families will probably enjoy this book, but I would recommend it to others as well. Not sure I'd assign it as a class-wide book even though there are plot points boys would connect with as well. A nice summertime read."", ""I haven't read a book like this before. I liked it, even though Callie doesn't"", ""Can't believe I finished this book in 1 day! This book is set back a while ago, which makes it definitely more interesting, and the characters are very likable, though I'd say the author included WAY too many uncles and aunts, it was hard to keep track of all of them and their professions."", 'Now that the New York Times has deemed it acceptable for adults to read young adult books, I guess I can review without shame. \n Anyway. Penny Falucci, a hardcore Brooklyn Dodgers fan growing up in New Jersey, is having a hard time as she turns 12 in 1953 -- her father died when she was a baby; her father\'s family and her mother\'s family won\'t talk to each other; her favorite uncle lives in a car in his mother\'s driveway; her favorite cousin is a budding gangster (he thinks being a criminal would be ""neat""); and her maternal grandmother, with whom she lives, is the worst cook in the history of the world. What\'s more, her mother has just started to date the milkman, and she\'s grounded for the rest of the summer because she went, against her mother\'s strict orders, into a public pool, where she\'s sure to catch polio. Most oddly of all, no one in the family will talk about her father or how he died. \n The book is somewhat langorously paced until the middle, when Penny\'s life takes a dramatic turn, but the characters are so well drawn and Penny\'s voice is so distinct and likeable that the relatively slow narrative doesn\'t matter all that much. (And the reveal about Penny\'s father will recount about an incident in American history you likely don\'t likely know about already.) Nicely done, if not overly exciting, period piece.', ""This book grew on me as I read it. Mid 1950's, growing up in NYC suburbs. I plan to read it aloud to my fourth grade class--interesting info about treatment of Italian-Americans during World War 2."", '""How can one of the most important people in your life disappear like he was never really there?"" \n --Penny from Heaven, P. 213 \n This crowning jewel sentence spreads out beautifully to form Penny from Heaven, a story that is inspired by the author\'s own Italian-American family. \n Jennifer L. Holm obviously understands humor, and it is spread liberally throughout this book, lining situations that might otherwise be totally serious with some funny moments as a ballast. \n The result is a book that is genuinely moving and significant, one that, in my view, certainly fits the parameters of being a ""distinguished contribution to literature for children."" I thought from the beginning that I would like Penny from Heaven, but I ended up really loving it. I hope that it continues to be read for many years to come.', ""If you like YA novels, or if you like historical fiction, check this out. I love Jennifer Holm's Babymouse comics, and it turns out I lover her fiction too!"", '2009', ""This book is a pleasant read however it doesn't have much plot. It seems something that would be appropriate and enjoyable for third or fourth grade children. It can be a good tool to introduce what happened in the US to Italians. Overall it was not too intense and had a pleasant ending."", 'this is a good book. not my fav but it was still really good!!! like ya!!', ""Living in the middle of nowhere provides me with lots of time to listen to books... It's at least 100 miles to anywhere. This book took us to a swim meet and back then off to Utah to see family. It's is a delightful story read by an excellent reader. If anyone out there likes to listen to a good book with your kids, try this one."", ""This book is about a young girl growing up in New Jersey in the fifties caught between her dead father's traditional Italian family and her mother and her mother's parents who are non Italian, non recently immigrated to the US, white people. I found the first 100 or so pages a little monotonous and uneventful, but the plot line that focuses on her father's death and the rupture between her father's family and her mother is pretty interesting. Enjoyable overall."", ""When I first heard about Penny From Heaven, it sounded like a dream. \n A funny story set in 1953 about a quirky Italian family? \n Sign me up! \n And for the most part, this book delivers. It's a sweet, funny, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting story about family, growing up, love, and butter pecan ice cream. It's a lazy summer day, when you don't have a care in the world. It's a Sunday dinner with your family all around you. It's a long laugh with your friends after a joke that was hardly funny. It's amazing. \n So why three stars? \n Well, parts of it seemed ridiculous. I get it--sometimes books are meant for escapism. But after so much good, there were parts that felt plastered-on, like Jennifer L. Holm was worried the reader was getting bored. \n Overall, it's sweet, crisp, and delicious. But a few rotten spots made it a little less."", 'this book surprised me. i didnt thinkk i wouls love it but it was really good. i definetly reccomend it!', 'I ended up really enjoying this story of an Italian American family set in the 1953. It was a little slow but it was an enjoyable book to read.', 'an enduring story about simple times', ""In 1953, 11-year-old Penny spends the summer hanging out with her large, eccentric Italian-American family. This warm-hearted story has tons of historical detail and a wacky, but loveable cast of characters. Penny tries to get someone to tell her exactly how her father died, but no one will. And when Penny's mother starts dating the milkman, it drives a wedge even further between them. Penny's one consolation is her Italian father's side of the family - a host of uncles who give her presents at every turn, a great cook of a grandma, and her firecracker cousin Frankie whose biggest ambition is to become a criminal mastermind. Penny's favorite member of the family is fellow Brooklyn Dodgers fan Uncle Dominic, an eccentric man who lives in his car and wears slippers instead of shoes. \n Based on the author's Italian relatives, the story includes an author's note that talks about the history and the people behind the characters."", 'Penny Falucci lives in a small town in New Jersey in a two story house. Her maternal grandparents live up stairs and her and her mother live downstairs. Her father is dead, but she imagines he was a lot like her uncle Dominic. Except he wouldn\'t live in a car and only wearing bedroom slippers. Penny from Heaven follows Penny through the summer as she turns twelve, her mother starts dating the milkman, her cousin and best friend Frankie gets in trouble with the law, and she finds out the truth behind her father\'s death. \n Peopled with Penny\'s paternal Italian-American family and her ""normal American"" maternal family. Both sides of the family, and Penny herself, are vividly painted, and the language, setting and plot are firmly grounded in 1950\'s small town, East Coast America. Holm\'s knack for dialog and understated use of 50\'s lingo immerses readers firmly in the era, without being irritating. \n When the truth about Penny\'s father, who died an ""enemy alien"" in an internment camp during WWII, is revealed, the story\'s understated theme of racism and intolerance is brought sharply into focus. The author\'s note provides further information on this little known episode in American history. Young readers may be able to relate the events and atmosphere of the story to events that are happening in their own lives. Overall, an engaging, well researched and timely piece of historical fiction.', ""When I started reading this book I was thinking 4 stars. Why you ask?

He's three, so having the rational 'all things die' talk wasn't going to cut it. I walked out with Dog Heaven. That night my son wanted to read it. It's a fantastic book full of bright colors and pictures of dogs having a great time. My son loved it. We were about half way through when something clicked inside him. He understood something. Maybe not all, but this book helped paint the picture. We had a long talk about our dog, Arwen, that night and how soon she would go to Dog Heaven too. At first it was difficult for him, but then the more we read Dog Heaven, the more he seemed to warm to the idea. We would flip through Cynthia's vibrant pages and talk about Arwen playing with the geese, sleeping on cloud pillows, or even coming to visit him and watch over him where he couldn't see. I needed a story, nothing instructional, to help my young son understand that going to dog heaven wasn't bad and that our beloved Arwen would have fun there. Dog Heaven did the trick. It continues to be a popular read in my home, and my son still talks about Arwen eating ham sandwich biscuits. Was it a perfect book? Not really, since Dog Heaven is a little 'churchy' for my taste, but the message was simple enough for my child to understand that Dog Heaven is a good place, a happy place, and one day he can see Arwen again.

God has a sense of humor since they get biscuits in the shape of cats and mailmen. And before going to sleep at night, the dogs turn around several times on a cloud to make sure that it all settles just right before they lay down.

But children also need to master their emotions. <i>Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child</i> is a guide to teaching children to understand and regulate their emotional world.

Be aware of the child\'s emotion \n 2. Recognize the emotion as an opportunity for intimacy and teaching \n 3. Listen empathetically and validate the child\'s feelings \n 4.

There is a lot of really good scientific research in this book, which I always appreciate. I recently ditched a parenting book because its main supporting text was the bible. :| \n This author is a psychotherapist who emphasizes empathy as the main way to relate to children. He talks about how damaging it can be to minimize their stress and the lasting effects of doing so, which can teach them to mistrust their own emotions. He also emphasizes the role of the family and the father especially, which I found fascinating. \n Of course in reading these books, I am partly looking for magic beans to get my toddler to stop whining forever. Of course there is no such magical advice but there is a lot of solid advice in this book to help you relate to your child far more effectively.', ""This was the best parenting book I've read so far. I'm not sure it would have helped much for under three years old, but for my kids ages now, 3 & 6, I found it refreshingly gentle and logical.

Good book."", ""So good! I'd recommend this to any parent. It has already helped how I relate to and communicate with my kids."", 'A few pages in and I had a spooky sense of dejavu-- am I crazy or have I read this all before somewhere? After a few more pages, the feeling was explained. Gottman was greatly influenced by the work of Haim Ginott, who did important research in childhood and communication, but who was not widely interpreted for the public until Faber\'s ""How so Kids will Listen and Listen so Kids will Talk"" translated his psychological principles into concrete parenting tools. \n So reading this, after loving ""How to Talk"" for years, is like meeting your best friend\'s sister. The similarities are surprising and the differences intriguing, and I find myself getting drawn into the puzzle of interpretation and mentorship, an almost Talmudic question or revision, meaning, context, transmission, source, authenticity, and generational divisions... \n But that\'s beside the point. \n This quick-read book gently but insistently reminds parents that children\'s feelings matter, and that rather than dismissing, squelching, or indulging in those feelings, parents need to take on a role of ""Emotional Coaches."" We have to listen to what the child is experiencing, help them label their feelings, and support them as they work out solutions. \n Gottman\'s body of empirical research-- based on years of work-- makes his parenting advice unique. Other books may say, ""don\'t yell at your kids, it\'s not good for them,"" where Gottman is able to say, ""don\'t yell at your kids, it causes the ambient level of stress hormones in their blood and urine to be constantly elevated which is detrimental to their emotional, physical and intellectual health."" \n He includes good solid Gottman advice that fans will recognize from his other works, but re-interpreted for parents. We need to have ""Mental maps"" of our kids\' lives, and avoid the ""Four Horseman"" in our families. There are reams of very practical advice for communicating well with kids, and giving them the skills they need to navigate their own difficult feelings for their lifetimes.', 'This book was really good but it felt like he repeated himself a lot. I would have liked more real life examples of how rather than explanations of why', 'Every parent should read this book. Parents of toddlers, parents of teenagers. There are so many things in this book that can help parents build trusting, communicative relationships with their children, and establish methods to help a child become ""emotionally intelligent."" The beginning of the book talks about how the emotional intelligence of a child is a far greater predictor of success (school performance, education, career opportunities, better peer relationships) in life than a child\'s mental intelligence, or IQ. It took a little while for me to be convinced that the strategies in this book would be effective, but now I\'m trying to use them every day in my parenting. \n Gottman presents five key steps to ""Emotion Coaching,"" which help children understand and regulate their emotions. The five key steps are these: \n 1. Be aware of the child\'s emotion \n 2. Recognize the emotion as an opportunity for intimacy and teaching \n 3. Listen empathetically and validate the child\'s feelings \n 4. Help the child verbally label emotions \n 5. Set limits while you help the child problem-solve \n Step number four I found especially enlightening as the book talked about how the act of labeling emotions can have a soothing effect on the nervous system: ""talking about an emotion as you\'re experiencing it engages the left lobe of the brain, which is the center of language and logic."" This helps the child calm down. Children rarely understand their feelings or can adequately express why they\'re having those feelings, so they need a parent to help them label their emotions. \n Another important thing I learned from this book is when to ignore ""Parental Agenda."" Gottman gives this example: \n Mom: ""What\'s the matter, sweetheart? You look kind of sad."" \n Andrew: ""I just wish I had a nicer sister."" \n Mom: ""Well, are you nice to her?"" \n ""Imagine now how Andrew must have felt about this question. Here was Mom, appearing to be interested in how he was feeling. But as soon as he opens up, she responds with criticism. Granted, it\'s well-intentioned, mild criticism, but it\'s criticism nonetheless."" \n The mom in this situation should have first responded empathetically; because she was critical, her son will probably not continue to share his feelings with her. \n Gottman cites Haim Ginott\'s principle: All feelings are permissible; not all behavior is permissible. ""The goal of Emotion Coaching is to explore and understand emotions, not to suppress them."" He also talks about how giving children choices helps them to build self-esteem. \n Here\'s some more from the book, in case you\'re intrigued: \n ""It is said that in Chinese the ideogram representing ""opportunity"" is encompassed in the ideogram for ""crisis."" Nowhere is the linking of these two concepts more apt than in our role as parents. Whether the crisis is a broken balloon, a failing math grade, or the betrayal of a friend, such negative experiences can serve as superb opportunities to empathize, to build intimacy with our children, and to teach them ways to handle their feelings. \n ""For many parents, recognizing children\'s negative emotions as opportunities for such bonding and teaching comes as a relief, a liberation, a great ""ah-ha."" We can look at our children\'s anger as something other than a challenge to our authority. Kids\' fears are no longer evidence of our incompetence as parents. And their sadness doesn\'t have to represent just ""one more blasted thing I\'m going to have to fix today."" \n ""To reiterate an idea offered by one Emotion-Coaching father in our studies, a child needs his parent most when he is sad or angry or afraid. The ability to help soothe an upset child can be what makes us ""feel most like parents."" By acknowledging our children\'s emotions, we are helping them learn skills for soothing themselves, skills that will serve them well for a lifetime. \n ""While some parents try to ignore children\'s negative feelings in the hope that they will go away, emotions rarely work that way. Instead, negative feelings dissipate when children can talk about their emotions, label them, and feel understood. It makes sense, therefore, to acknowledge low levels of emotion early on before they escalate into full-blown crises. If your five-year-old seems nervous about an upcoming trip to the dentist, it\'s better to explore that fear the day before than to wait until the child is in the dentist chair, throwing a full-blown tantrum. If your twelve-year-old feels envious because his best friend got the position he coveted on the baseball team, it\'s better to help him talk over those feelings with you than to let them boil over in a row between the two buddies next week. \n ""Addressing feelings that are low in intensity before they escalate also gives families a chance to practice listening and problem-solving skills while the stakes are small. If you express interest and concern over your child\'s broken toy or a minor scrape, these experiences are building blocks. Your child learns that you are his ally and the two of you figure out how to collaborate. Then if a big crisis occurs, you are prepared to face it together."" \n Anyway, I am sold. Every parent should read this book.', ""Parents: If you read one parenting book, I think this slim volume should be it! \n It has been more than a month since I finished reading Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child by John Gottman (published 1998). By waiting to write my thoughts, I may not have as many specific examples and quotes to share. However, by letting the book percolate in my mind as I went about my life, I can even better declare that Gottman's slim volume is a helpful and essential reminder of the role of parents in the lives of young children. \n While parents and teachers often devote lots of time to teaching academics and well rounded activities (from music to athletics), how often have parents considered the ways they are helping their children develop emotional intelligence? In a world were people are increasingly pulled in a variety of directions, the ability to regulate emotions and control one self in a complicated world is essential. Gottman's book helps me see my opportunities for teaching my kids. It also gives me realistic ways to implement the teaching of emotional strength. \n More thoughts on this great book on my blog \n To sum: Let's make sure this rising generation doesn't grow up to become a generation of out-of-control road raging adults, okay?"", 'Got this book rec. from a speaker I heard at Austin\'s preschool last night whose topic was called ""Raising Responsible Children"". It was VERY informative and I am excited for this book!', ""This is a book I want to read again and again so I can learn new things to deal with my kids at different stages. Here is what I learned this time through: \n * The basic premise of this book is that a parent shouldn't try to control or censure a child's feelings, but they should set limits on behavior. I really like the balance he suggests. \n * The most helpful thing for me in my current stage as a parent was the concept that I don't have to fix everything. I find it very stressful when Sandy cries and fusses because I feel like I must not be meeting her needs. Since I've read this book, I've found that I can be more patient with Sandy crying. I'm trying to understand what she's feeling--and verbalize it. Then, if I can do something about it I do. If I can't, I can just sit with her and let her cry or fuss. I still have a lot to learn on this one. \n * After reading this book, I want to be more empathetic in all of my relationships with other people. My goal is to stop more and think about how the other person is feeling, clarify and reflect until I am sure I am correct about the emotions, and try to feel that emotion with them."", 'A bit outdated as it was written so long ago, but mostly consistent with current research.

Overall, not groundbreaking new info but a great reminder to slow down and feel."", 'Although the theories in this book are good ones, it is very similar to How to Talk So Your Kids Will Listen and Listen So Your Kids Will Talk which I find to be more informative of this particular parenting style.', 'There are many parenting books out there that are as controversial as they are popular. You use what you find helpful and ignore what doesn\'t fit in with your own personal parenting philosophy. I found most of Goleman\'s techniques in this book to be insightful and invaluable. \n Too often, we may find ourselves giving in to venting our anger or frustration at our children for our own emotional benefit, forgetting that they are not adept at reading their own feelings much less yours. It is too easy to discount our little ones\' cries as merely manipulative attempts to get what they want. (The author DOES recognize that children DO try to manipulate adults in this way and recommends not using emotion coaching in those instances.) This is a realistic, practical, and easily read book told from the perspective of a father who also relays helpful instances in his own life where he\'d used emotion coaching. \n One benchmark that I often use to judge parenting books are their philosophies on punishment, particularly time-outs. Goleman believes in the proper implementation of time-outs. They are to be consistent and respectful, not opportunities to emotionally berate or humiliate children. He believes that it is best used for children aged 3-8 and should last about a minute. You may want use Amazon\'s search-within-a-book feature and search for ""time-out"" to get a better idea. \n The author sites studies showing that emotional intelligence is linked to higher reading and math IQ\'s, social competence, and physical health. We all wish the best for our children, and reading this book will help you to be the best parent you can be.

But her baby daughter has a nought father . . . Jude is a Nought. Eaten up with bitterness, he blames Sephy for the terrible losses his family has suffered . . .<br /><br />Now Jude's life rests on a knife edge. Will Sephy be forced, once again, to take sides?<br /><br />A razor-sharp and intensely moving novel, the second in the <i>Noughts &amp; Crosses</i> sequence.",Knife_Edge,"['\'ve only dipped my toe so as to speak into Malorie Blackman\'s excellent young adult reads so far, starting with the brilliant Noughts And Crosses (read my review HERE) and now with the follow up Knife Edge. Well, I might be a bit of a latecomer to the party but blow me down with a feather she is a superb writer! I always worry with a series that it might suffer from ""second book syndrome,"" or tail off and lose my interest but I enjoyed the sequel just as much as I did the first. I\'m going to try my hardest not to spoil things for those of you that haven\'t begun the series yet but it might be better if you go off and read the first book then come back and read my review! \n Okay, so where the first novel focuses on two Romeo and Juliet-esque characters who are fated never to be together purely because of the difference in their skin colours, the second tends to focus and hone in on a couple of these characters - Persephone (Sephy to her friends) and Jude. After the nail-biting and shocking ending of Noughts & Crosses, Sephy has a hell of a lot more to be worried about then just relationships. She now has a whole new life to be responsible for in the form of Callie Rose, a daughter named for her father and more precious to her than anything else. Life never runs smoothly for Sephy sadly and she ends up moving in with Callum\'s mother Meggie who is not completely delighted to have her there but begins to dote on her little grand-child. Poor Sephy is also suffering from what happened in the last novel along with a bout of post natal depression which begins to threaten her relationship with her daughter. \n As well as Sephy\'s viewpoint, we also get one from another familiar character - Jude, Callum\'s brother who is on the run after being wanted as a member of the Liberation Militia, a violent organisation seeking equal rights for Noughts in a world ruled by inequality. He is absolutely furious with Sephy (and with all Crosses in general) for what he believes she has put his family through and when something happens to him that shakes his whole belief system, their paths cross again. Will she help him or will it be daggers at dawn? \n I\'ve got to admit I had no idea about which way Malorie Blackman was going to take this story after the ending of the first novel (which was pure fireworks for me, by the way) and I\'m really pleased she dug down a bit deeper into her characters mindsets. We have suffered with Sephy from the very beginning of the series but in Knife Edge we see her becoming a mother, overcoming obstacles and really growing as a person. But Jude - what can I say? He is a vile, disgraceful and embarrassing piece of humanity but by the author exploring his character in more depth and allowing for a tiny glimmer of good that he might possess, I even started feeling a bit sorry for him! Only a bit, mind you. Once again, I also loved the way in which the author presented this dystopian world not too far removed from our own, where skin colour can mean everything in life is granted or taken away from you. And the ending? Oh dear Lord, she\'s done it again....it\'s one terrific cliffhanger that will have you grabbing for the third book in this four book series Checkmate immediately! \n For my full review please see my blog at http://www.bibliobeth.com', ""I read Noughts and Crosses many years ago when I was much younger, so wasn't sure if the sequal would still hold the same appeal for me. I needn't have worried however, because I loved it! I don't think it was as good as the first book as the storyline wasn't as strong or prominent, but it was definitely worth my time. \n I love the way that the book portrays racism in a way not normally thought of and am really looking forward to reading the next book."", ""I'm really loving this book series!!!"", ""I didn't enjoy this as much as #1 in the series but excellent nonetheless. One of my favourite teen series, and a Keeper."", ""This book left me an emotional mess. This book broke my heart. Poor Sephy heaving to deal with being a teen mom, missing Callum having such a hard life. And if that's not enough she's having a serious condition postpartum depression. I hated Callum's letter and I was hoping that Sephy would know better than believe the letter. I guessing there's more to that letter, maybe something to do with Sephy's father. \n My heart broke for Callie for not growing up with her father, for not having a happy healthy mom, for being biracial not belonging with neither the Cross or a knight. For not growing up in stable loving family. \n My heart broke for Meggie can't that poor woman get a break and at the same time I admire her she is strong and still brave trying to make the best in a very shitty situation. \n My heart broke for Cara that she had to suffer because of Jude's demons. \n I hated Jude in the beginning of the book I was thinking that maybe he can change and become a better person, but he's the devil incarnation. \n Malorie is a gifted writer and her books are gripping and deal with heavy topics.

May the conclusion to this trilogy bring some hope and a better world for noughts and crosses alike."", ""I'm not sure whether I enjoyed this one more or less than the first. This is a very well made sequel, with nice bits of character development and heartbreaking plot lines. It shows how nobody is perfect and how a book series can draw you in even without your favourite character Callum isn't in it."", 'an amazing book that covers some tough issues, couldnt put it down!', ""The second in the noughts and crosses series. I hugely enjoyed noughts and crosses but felt a little let down by knifes edge it seemed to be too long for the things that happened in it of which there weren't many. I also think if I hadn't have read an eye for a eye before it I would have struggled to comprehend some of the events. \n Some spoilers... \n Noughts and crosses was a book about racial prejudice and hate but it was also a book about love. It was gripping because you the reader believed in Sephy and Callum and connected with them as characters. Knifes edge however was different. I can't say I honestly liked or connected with any of the characters who narrated the story. First there's Jude evil beyond comprehension and its not just because of his brothers death he was evil before it in noughts and crosses he always picked on Callum and Lynette. But when he falls for cara you honestly start thinking things are going to change for him then he brutally kills her with his feet and fists. Even when Sephy helps him by giving him an alibi and allowing him to frame his arch enemy he still won't rest without his 'revenge' on her and his little baby niece. \n You've got Minerva who is selfish and callous who only cares about herself and throws a paddy when she doesn't get what she wants. She's definitely her fathers daughter. \n Jasmine and Meggie are equally weak minded and the only purpose they serve is to give an observers view on Sephy's behaviour. \n Then you've got Sephy herself one minute she hates her child then she loves it then she hates it then she loves it enough to kill it. Make your mind up woman! \n And the plot itself. What good did giving Jude an alibi do for Sephy or her daughter if anything it only made everything worse. And what was with Sephy joining a band?'! Where did that come from and what relevance does it hold? \n I'm going to persevere with the series in the hope it gets better but at the moment I'm thinking it should have been a one hit wonder stand alone book and not a series at all."", 'https://cdnbookworm.blogspot.ca/2017/...', 'Better than the first book...', ""Malorie Blackman stop breaking my heart!!! This is the 2nd book of the noughts and crosses series and it is just as heartbreaking as the first. After the ending of the first book, I was actually nervous about starting the 2nd. And apparently I was right to be nervous! This is an excellent series so far. It's the kind of story that sticks with you throughout the day and you just keep thinking of it and the characters. One character in particular was just such a roller coaster! No spoilers but that part of the story made me gasp. The 3rd and 4th books are on their way and I can't even imagine."", ""Knife Edge is the sequel to Noughts & Crosses (first read 2009) and also follows the events of Eye For An Eye (2010). \n Given the tragic ending of Noughts, it's hardly surprising the characters don't begin Knife whooping and skipping for joy. But the first 10 or so instalments focus heavily on the prequel in vague, depressing terms. For those who have read Noughts, it becomes quickly tiresome. For those who missed it, the references are too vague to bring anyone up to speed. \n When the story finally picks up, it does so in a more linear and eventful way than it's predecessor. Instead of a circular will-they/won't-they, Knife throws in new twists and developments all the time. \n The birth of Callie Rose brings an interesting new element to the table: the Hadleys and McGregors are now related; Meggie is Callie's grandmother and Jude is her uncle. Blackman does well to bring these relationships into play, especially Sephy and Jude, and the revised relationship between Jasmine and Meggie. \n Jude and Cara's relationship is also well developed, particularly given the characters involved. The climax is a highlight of the book. It's so beautifully and carefully crafted that it's almost overwhelming. \n The multiple narrators are back, with Jude taking over Callum's rotation. With so much doubt and subterfuge over everyone else's true thoughts, feelings and motivations it works well. Also, particularly in Jude's case, it helps the reader retain sympathy with both sides of the racial divide. It was great to see Jasmine and Meggie stepping into the narrating fray but it's a shame it was so near the end. By this time they could only retrospectively confirm or deny Sephy's suspicions. \n Blackman tried a few other things too. The newspaper articles punctuated the narrative quite successfully, however the colours with lists of associated sentiments were bizarre, even if appropriate to the theme; they added nothing. Most annoying were Sephy's letters to Callie at the beginning of the book, written in cringeworthy, butt clenching styles. There and elsewhere, Blackman also switches inexplicably from past to present tense, which may seek to add tension or drama, but actually just annoys. \n I would query that this series would be appropriate fir children with swearing, sex, prostitution, suicidal thoughts and mature themes all present. It's also worth noting that Blackman's deliberate cliffhanger is completely ruined by the publisher's preview of Book 3 which gives the game away."", 'I really enjoyed the second instalment to the noughts and crosses series. \n I am currently reading the third book and the second book was needed to show the relationship between Jude and Sephy. The hatred between them. I think the ""eye for an eye"" story although written for a bonus feature should of been in the book to again highlight the plot and future for the third book. \n In the book I thought Jude was changing, seeing the light but then BAM, he spoils it for himself. Jude lives by his own rules he made. \n Sephy is trying to raise her daughter and still do write by the world. She joins a nohght band which gives us an insight into the music industry. Then also her sister Minerva joins the newspapers as an apprentice. Really enjoyed the newspaper articles within the story. \n Thought it was a really good read.', '""There are no such things as friends. Just acquaintances who haven\'t let you down yet."" \n Set in a dystopian 21st century Britain, the second in the Noughts and Crosses quadrilogy picks up where its predecessor left off. As with the first in the series, the book is told through multiple perspectives, but focuses heavily on Sephy and Jude (with snippets of Jasmine and Meggie) coming to terms with their new lives following the devastation caused in book one. \n Blackman is an incredible storyteller. This no holes barred tale makes for shocking yet compulsive reading. Whilst the plot is slower moving than Noughts and Crosses, this volume allows the reader greater insight into the emotional responses of the characters, and helps to set up the conclusion to the series.', 'That ending though. Thank God Checkmate was close at hand! :D (thanks Katie :D )', 'a very good book. it goes into depth the consequences of what happened in the ending of noughts and crosses. my only problem with this book is that it seemed unnecessary. Noughts and Crosses didnt really need this book, but i suppose it did helo you understand the characters more. Another problem is that i thought it kinda blended and merged in with the 3 book in the series, so much so that they seem more like one book and i wouldnt be able to tell the details of what happened in which exact book. overall though, a very good book and it kept me gripped :) x', ""It didn't blow me away as much as the first book did, but once I got a few chapters in I was hooked again.

No, it wasn't the same as Noughts and Crosses but after what happened at the end of N&C it could never be. It had to be a different book. And it was. And that worked. The addition of Jude narrating was a master stroke because while Jude is perhaps a Marmite character, I like him. I feel like there's something in him that's redeemable (although after reading Knife Edge perhaps I'm wrong because what he does is actually disgusting). But despite everything he does, I still like Jude as a character. I feel like he has so much depth. \n The hardest part to read is Sephy. After everything she went through previously, it had to change her in some ways and while she's still the same old Sephy in some ways, mostly that's gone. This is a different girl. And it's heartbreaking to see her suffering. It's heartbreaking to read everything she's going through because I just wanted to take away her pain and I couldn't. \n Knife Edge was vastly different to Noughts and Crosses. In tone. In voice.

Malorie Blackman can certainly write a good, complex villain. Jude is a monster, but one that you can understand.

I think I loved them more than Callum's chapters in the first book, (don't get me wrong I love Callum). I think Jude's chapter's are so interesting because he is such a complex character. Sephy sees him as a man who is purely evil and very, very smart. Maggie sees Jude as her only son. Jude is rather torn between two different things. He wants to remain loyal to his rules, his prejudice against Crosses and his promise to kill Sephy after she 'killed' or 'caused' his brother's death . Very quickly in the book he meets a Cross girl named Cara. She is everything that Jude does not expect, she believes in equality between Noughts and Crosses. She listens to music whether it is 'Nought' music or 'Cross' music. In her salon she respects and cares for her Nought customers as much as her Cross customers. She is engaging and lovely. And Jude is forever going through whether is he leading her on, as he wished, or is he falling in love with a Cross? Anyway, Jude ends up killing her. You do end up feeling sympathy for Jude, but he is very manipulative and ruthless. So you are never sure what to truly think of Jude. That's what I liked about his character. \n I really liked the fast paced plot and I also liked Sephy's chapters in this book.

I read it in one day and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was emotional, intense and thought provoking. I realise I\'ve not yet done a review on the first book and for the time being, you\'ll just have to take the previous sentences as a review for it until I get my backside in gear. Knife Edge continues the series where the first book left off. I\'ve had this book sitting on my shelf waiting to be read, for nearly a year now, and despite that amount of time passing, I dove back into this world with no problems at all. This second novel follows a different style of narration than the original book, because a large portion of it is narrated by Sephy, writing mental letters to her daughter. Blackman\'s style of writing is just as addicting as it always was, and chapters flew by in minutes when reading knife edge. \n I always feel strange marking this series on my shelves as ""dystopia"", since that theoretically is meant to describe a ""broken society different from our own""- but really the whole point of this series is that it is simple a mirror image of our society. One in which the racist-tables have turned. I\'m not so blind and ""naive white girl"" to innocently believe that racism doesn\'t happen in this world and that there is probably a million things which are ""whitewashed"" daily which I don\'t even bat an eyelid to. This series really makes me question racism in society in general and how even the simplest things convey messages without even being ethnicity related. For example, constant casting of white males and females in Hollywood movies, despite that facts that in the books, the characters are often not Caucasian at all. \n This book follows Sephy as she struggles to raise her daughter as a single parent, while still dealing with the familial and political fallouts from the first novel. Callum\'s brother, Jude is on the run while working within the LM, a Nought ""terrorist"" group fighting for Nought rights. Sephy struggles between her emotions for her daughter, her dead lover, her dangerous position in the nought/cross society now she has made herself a ""blanker"". While I did enjoy this book, I did find a couple of flaws within it, which made me knock off a star- but mostly, it is a strong sequel which has made me want to continue the series further- be warned, book 2 ends on a cliffhanger! \n For more of my reviews, please visit thebookheap \n http://thebookheap.wordpress.com', ""In a world where white people are oppressed and black people are the oppressors a newborn mixed baby is going to have a tough time fitting it. Sephy will do anything to protect her baby, even move in with the mother of her baby's father on the wrong side of the tracks. She struggles with her emotions and tries to figure out how she feels about her baby's deceased father, Callum, without holding anything against her child. \n After truly enjoy the previous book in the Naughts & Crosses series I had high hopes for this book, but it fell short. Sephy became insufferable. She truly had so many places she could turn, but decided to be pigheaded about it. Jude, Callum's brother, definitely had a more interesting plotline as he tries to deal with his inbred racism despite being drawn to a white woman. The book dragged and wasn't nearly as good as the first book."", 'This was a very powerful novel, one which I thoroughly enjoyed. I would definitely recommend.', 'Intense!!

I felt so sorry for Callie rose and the way Sephy felt she had to bring her up. I hated Jude more and more as the book went on. I love Tobey. I cried at the end. I was so sad but happy about what jasmine and Meggie chose to do and I was so so happy for Callie rose and Sephy. It felt like it took so long to read this book but it was so worth it for the ending.', ""Callie Rose, who wants to be know as Rose, is older, and Check Mate alternates between the present, and the past. The past chapters are in various points of view, Jude, Callie, Sephy, Jasmine and Meggie. With Callie's chapters we get to see her grow up, each chapter is a different year in her life. We get a first hand look at her feelings towards her Dad as she learns more about him, as well as letters she writes to him. Her friendship with Tobey is portrayed through the book and one thing I liked was how gullible she is towards him, believing everything he says like a true friend would. \n Sephy is still trying to deal with Callum's death, while it isn't a prominent issue, it's constantly in the background, and we can see how this has affected her emotional relationship with Callie Rose along with her relationships with boyfriends. \n Check Mate is another great instalment in this series, Jude has found Callie and he will stop at nothing in order to exact his revenge on Sephy and her family, even if it means using Callie to get what he needs. While I don't agree with what Callie does, I do feel sorry for her. All the secrets about her Dad are revealed unexpectedly and having no-one to turn to she goes to the one person who she shouldn't have gone to, who pretends to be there for her, and it slowly starts a downward spiral of things she shouldn't even think about, never mind doing them. \n Throughout Check Mate we get to see more of Jasmine and Meggie, and how bad news can bring a broken family back together. Check Mate is even more nerve wracking than the previous books, and whenever the book went back to Jasmine I was on tenterhooks wondering what would happen. In the back of my mind I knew what the end result would be, but I didn't want it to end like this, and still hoped I was wrong.

I am now onto book four and would definitely recommend this series.', 'My personal fave!', ""My only gripe with this book is the time jumping was a bit confusing and not set out very clearly. But I really enjoyed that the book showed what happened in the present and then went back to explain how it came to that. \n I loved how Jude was too dog I could see thy one coming because he is ruthless enough. And I liked how Callie grew up and how other people easily influenced her because it shows that children are easy to influence and it isn't always their fault but how they were raised."", 'What happened with this series? It started out so promising, and this was so boring :/', 'This is the fourth book in a series of six, and before you read this book, you must start with the first book and read them in order. I read the first book, NOUGHTS AND CROSSES, in October 2006, long before I began this blog. It was a gripping and mesmerizing book, which should be required reading for all students. Then I read AN EYE FOR AN EYE, a much shorter novella, and KNIFE EDGE, both in May 2011. As I started the second book, I had to look up a synopsis of the first book to familiarize myself with the story. As with the first book, I loved the second and third books. \n I definitely should not have waited so long to read CHECKMATE. I often had to pause and remember what had happened in previous books in order to not be confused. And while I liked the book, I did not love it as much as the previous books, but I think if I\'d read it while the others were still fresh in my mind I would have gotten a lot more out of it. \n This books takes us through Callie Rose\'s life from age seven to age sixteen. As in the previous books, the short chapters are all told in first person, alternating between characters - Callie Rose, her mother, Sephy, her grandmothers, Jasmine and Meggie, and her father\'s brother, Jude. In the early years, all Callie Rose knows about her father is that he was a gardener and died in a car accident while her mum was pregnant with her. But as she grows older, and particularly after Jude first makes contact with her, she begins to learn more about who her father really was, and finds herself drawn into the Liberation Militia and training to be a soldier under her uncle\'s command. \n I think my biggest issue was that I found Sephy to now be a very unsympathetic character. She loves her daughter, but she cannot bring herself to show her daughter real affection. For example (and pardon me for not indenting this quote properly but I just cannot seem to figure out how to do so): \n I was about to give Callie a hug, but I caught myself in time. I gave her a pat on the head and a kiss on the forehead instead. \n \'Mum, I\'m not a dog who just retrieved a bone, thank you very much,"" Callie complained. (pg 237) \n And she constantly thinks to herself that now is the time to tell her daughter the truth about her father, and then she lets the moment pass and doesn\'t do so. Of course, she has her reasons for both of these issues, misguided though they may be, but for most of the book I was angry and disappointed at her. \n The last third of the book took me back into that mesmerized didn\'t want to put it down state, but for a 500 page book it took a while to get that drawn in.', ""Read this when I was younger but re-reading as there is a 4th when I only read the trilogy. \n Gets more real and emotional the further into the series you get. The characters develop further and each persons voice is so clear, turning to any page you could work out who it was without their name on the chapter beginning. \n Tension builds and builds and you read on waiting to see what will happen. \n Good to hear Callie's voice and the flashbacks form when she was young were so sad. \n Very well-written."", ""A very nice conclusion to a wonderful series. \n Parts of this last volume bothered me a little bit - there's a lot of hatred and communication issues that I'm sure could've been avoided if certain characters weren't so stubborn , but I'm so invested in the trilogy as a whole that it didn't really take away from my experience with the series."", '31/2-4 stars', 'I enjoyed this one as much as Naughts and Crosses, and a bit more than Knife Edge. I thought the drama was spread out, and I just *had* to keep reading to find out what happened next. I thought the historical backstory was well balanced with what was going on in the present day, and I thought it kept the tension rising perfectly. Definitely going to be finding the last in the trilogy (since when is a trilogy 4 books!) to read now!', ""A very fitting conclusion to a fantastic series. I've been warned off the fourth one, and i felt that this rounded off the trilogy nicely, so I think I will leave it there. The ending is slightly ambigious as you are expected to assume that certain events have happened, but I liked it and this meant there was plenty to discuss with friends afterwards!"", ""The basic idea is imagine if black people were socially superior in the way that white people used to be in prejudiced states. Chuck in a simple love story across the boundaries, throw a lot of family issues and that's pretty much it. \n Despite sounding like a pretty unoriginal cliched plot, Blackman crafts her characters well and I actually found myself engaging with the novel. Worth a pick up if you fancy something easy to read."", ""I'd forgotton what a good writer Malorie Blackman was and couldn't put it down until I'd finished it at 2 in the morning! This book although based on racial prejudice also touches on how a secret in the family can cause a rift. Blackman's writing is superbe and she always stays true to her characters. I love the way she lets each character tell the story from their own point of view and she always does it convincingly. If you loved the first two books this is a must read as it is as good as the first book and better than the second. I can't wait for the next one to come out."", 'It was brilliant, I got very emotional towards the end but I am intrigued to see how the 4th book brings it all together, overall was very good x', 'The final book to this amazing trilogy. Checkmate was a thrilling and edgy end. \n Finally brought closure to the story. \n I personally enjoyed the beginning where it is present time when Callie-Rose is 16 and then goes back in time to explain how everyone got to the positions they were in which lead up to present day again. \n I also felt I learnt a lot more about Meggie and Jude and the struggles they have been through as Noughts. I felt Malorie Blackman explored their past to give a bigger picture to give a perspective regardless of how good or bad they were.', 'Checkmate is the third book in the fabulous Noughts & Crosses series by a woman I\'ve come to think of as a YA genius - Malorie Blackman. I am going to try and write this review as spoiler free as I can for anybody who hasn\'t started the series yet but it gets harder with each successive book in the series. I heartily recommend anyone who is interested in dystopian fiction, prejudice and racial tension to read these books and discover the magic of them for yourself. \n Our main character from the first book, Sephy is back and she has had a daughter, Callie Rose whom she is raising by herself with the help of her mother and Callie\'s father\'s mother. Callie is growing up in tough times where black people (known as Crosses) are the ""superior"" race and whites (known as Noughts) are treated with scorn and derision. Callie\'s problem is that she has a Cross mother and a Nought father, so in effect is mixed race and suffers terrible prejudice from both sides of the divide. Checkmate is Callie\'s coming of age story as she grows up in a hostile world, tries to connect with her often emotionally distant mother and finds out things about her family that may have been better left hidden and may have dangerous consequences. \n To be perfectly honest, this book did not have as much of an effect on me as the previous two books in the series, Noughts & Crosses and Knife Edge, Apart from the ending that is, which is quite literally explosive and incredibly tense, paving the way for a potentially devastating final book in the series. I loved Callie Rose as a character and could see a lot of her mother in her young self but found myself becoming quite frustrated with Sephy at times as her wariness around her daughter was truly heart-breaking to read. I loved the way that this novel was told from the perspective of multiple characters once again, this is one of my favourite ways to read as I feel it gives you a much deeper insight into the mind of certain characters, especially ones where you can\'t quite accept their motives. Say no more....apart from please start this series if you haven\'t already and let me know what you think! \n For my full review and many more, please visit my blog at http://www.bibliobeth.com', 'A wonderful conclusion to this thought-provoking and emotional trilogy revolving around equality and prejudice. I loved how she crafted and developed all her characters throughout the books, especially Jude and Sephy. I liked how we get to see the alternating points of views between Callie, Sephy, Meggie, Jasmine and Jude. The first book will always be my favourite, but they all hold merit.', 'A lovely little novel that demonstrates the talent of Malorie Blackman.', ""The last in the Noughts & Crosses trilogy catches up with Sephy & Callum's daughter Callie Rose as a teen. She's trying to find her place in the world but is hamstrung by the dire family relationships around her and her discovery of what really happened to her dad. When her mysterious uncle Jude makes contact, Callie looks set to join the Liberation Militia and become notorious in her own right. \n Took me a while to get through this one; it could have used a bit of editing down. I got frustrated with the lack of communication, between Sephy & Callie, Sephy & her mother-in-law, Sephy & her own mother. Basically Sephy was quite annoying! \n Overall I would say that Noughts & Crosses itself is well worth reading; the sequels less so."", ""En gros, Un T3 qui se passe des annees plus tard et que j'ai apprecie, meme si je l'ai trouve moins equilibre et moins bon que les 2 premiers. Trop de tension suivi de trop de platitude et ainsi de suite. Les retours dans le temps (passe, present, passe, ...) sont egalement parfois un peu maladroits a mon avis. Ceci dit, l'histoire reste interessante et la multitude de points de vue y apporte une certaine richesse. Les personnages sont toujours aussi vrais et la manifestation de la haine atteint ici des sommets dans la persistance et la duree.

I tried to smile away the pin-prick tears making my eyes sting. But I wasn\'t fooling anyone...I\'m to late."" (Page 412) Just about sums it up. This series is amazing! It\'s a story that makes you think how you see people (by race/culture etc). It\'s a story of the relationship of the women. It\'s a story of mothers and daughters. It\'s a superbly written love story. It\'s a story of friendship. It\'s a story about finding your place in the world. I can not recommend this series enough!! This book was the third, one more to go. There is no ""filler"" in any of the books. No 2nd book syndrome or any other pitfalls of series. Whatever the highest rating I can give, I give.', ""Checkmate begins sixteen years after Knife Edge concluded, with two colossal showdowns taking place. From that point, the book splits into threads - one continuing the showdowns until the book's climax and the other recounting the intervening sixteen years to demonstrate how they came to be. \n The concept works really well. The breakdown of Sephy and Callie-Rose's relationship, and Jasmine's increasing desperation, are believably depicted, and each time stream adds a layer of detail to the other. We hear the familiar narrative voice of Blackman through her various narrators (this time including Sephy, Callie-Rose, Jasmine, Meggie, Jude and - in a brief cameo - Callum), but with the added dual timeline twist. It's a good time to shake things up as we reach the third major volume (fourth overall if you include An Eye for an Eye) and the format change is refreshing. The passing time is marked by giving Callie-Rose's age before each of her narrative turns from childhood through to sixteen, which is appropriate given her central role in proceedings and makes the timeline easy to follow. \n Callie-Rose integrates quickly into the cast and easily becomes a prominent figure. She finds her own voice and is a different lead character from Sephy. It helps that everyone else is somehow acting or reacting to her - Sephy in reacting to their relationship, Meggie in trying to preserve her place in her life, Jude in trying to corrupt her. By the end of the book, it seems that she has always been involved in the series. We see an interesting difference in society from when Sephy was her age some twenty years before; we see for the first time how a mixed race person fits into the dystopia; and most interestingly we understand how Callie-Rose's impression of Callum is substantially different from the reader's. \n The reader finds themselves rooting for events, people and relationships and Blackman does enjoy teasing us before switching timestream on us now and again. \n Checkmate was originally written to be the last instalment, and it would have been a fitting (if surprising) conclusion. It will be very interesting to see where the writer chooses to go from here."", 'This series just gets better and better. The first is of course the best of all four, but they each hold merit, and this was an enjoyable read.', 'What can I say? Malorie Blackman this book is stunning. As usual :D', 'My second most favourite book in the series, and if only to read the *deleted sex scene we missed in book one. Also I was interested in seeing Callie Rose growing up, and nearly being sucked in by her uncle Jude, and her sweet relationship with Toby, though the parallels to Callum and Sephy are quite clear.', ""After the disappointment of Knife Edge, the previous book in this trilogy, I wasn't sure which way this one was going to go. After spending the afternoon racing through it, I am pleased to announce that Checkmate is as good as Noughts and Crosses which I adored. YAY! \n While Knife Edge seemed to be lacking the edginess and the intensity of plot I found in Noughts and Crosses, Checkmate did not have that problem. It was angsty, it was powerful, it was emotional. The lives of these characters are still not at ease, all of them still fighting with the ghosts of their collective past and poor Callie Rose, dragged into the middle of it all, is just trying to work out who she is and where she belongs. \n Sephy has changed dramatically since Noughts and Crosses but at times I can see her old self shine through and what's more is that I see her in Callie. The development of mother and daughter was flawless - all their fights, arguments, mistakes on both parts, and in the end their love for each other, tied together by the memory of Callum. Callum, though killed in the first book, is an overhanging presence in all their lives, even all those years later. And I always knew that letter was a fake! \n Meggie has changed dramatically in this book. Her vindictiveness was quite surprising and I would have thought she would have treated Sephy better. I also don't know how they managed to live in the same house for more than ten years hardly speaking to one another. I believed Sephy was well within her rights to be angry and upset, and also that Meggie had reason to worry - but of course went about it all the wrong way. The problem with these characters is that they've all been broken and hurt so many times they don't know who to trust. I guess this is why the ending gave me so much to be hopeful for. I found myself not caring which boys or men were in either of Callie or Sephy's lives, but mainly caring about their relationship with each other. Makes you wish they had had that conversation a long time ago. \n When you care about characters (as I inevitably do) reading a book where they make so much trouble and cause so much pain for each other can be very hard! However, I very much enjoyed this 'conclusion' to the 'trilogy' (though I have another book??) and I don't mind about the extra book as again I find myself unable to let go."", 'Read this in like 24 hours. \n So action packed. \n So intense. \n SO good.', 'Set in a dystopian 21st century near future British society - the \'Noughts & Crosses\' award winning series of novels (initially a trilogy, subsequently extended to a quadrilogy) opens following a period of alternative history, a post slavery period where the white population (Noughts) have been enslaved by the ruling black elite. Now post emancipation, it is the non-black population who are distinctly disadvantaged and impoverished in this alternative future society which is ruled and controlled by the dominating blacks (Crosses). \n The \'Noughts & Crosses\' series provides us with an explicit flip and twist on both the history and current political and cultural demographic of British society - where racial politics is turned on its head and power structures are completely reversed. \n The fundamental premise underlying this series is a vitally important one - what Malorie Blackman seems to have set out to do, is to robustly challenge (what may be many) readers\' current perceptions, presumptions, assumptions and views on race and (British) society. An attempt to provoke thought and to revisit the absurdities of a society(ies) run along lines on racial disadvantagement and the domination of one ethnic group or groups in society by another controlling ethnic (almost always white) group. The books successfully challenge and encourage particularly the non-black reader to reconsider and think again about being part of and party to, a racially privileged white society - and by extension, to consider the real life alternative in the light of the fictional world that is portrayed here in the \'Noughts & Crosses\' series. Moreover - to consider the possibility of a third way - a society run entirely along non-racially defined power structures. \n This is an original, intelligent, perceptive and though-provoking series of books - and whilst squarely aimed at the Young Adult market, it clearly transcends the restrictive boundaries of that genre. \n The first installment \'Noughts & Crosses\' is the strongest of the series, closely followed by the second and third parts of the original trilogy namely \'Knife Edge\' and \'Checkmate\'. Whilst \'Double Cross\' is well-written and ostensibly does add value to the series, it does feel ultimately a little superfluous and does not provide the same impact as the preceding three novels. \n Moreover, apart from being politically and culturally astute, what makes the \'Noughts & Crosses\' series of books so successful is not merely the originality and the ever-present / underlying theme of racial politics, but the fact that Blackman has created great characters who inhabit great page-turning stories which are both compelling and engaging. \n These are increasingly important books to be read by all - particularly in view of the current political climate and the ever more disturbing rise in the so-called \'alt right\' / white supremacist groups in certain parts of the world. \n It is very encouraging that Blackman\'s series of books has been so successful and is widely read and made available in UK schools - as it quite rightly should continue to be. \n Throughout the course of the \'Noughts & Crosses\' series of novels, Malorie Blackman successfully shines a light on the absurdities of racial domination and subjugation of one group by another and the fundamental racist agenda (implicit and explicit, covert and overt - at both personal and societal levels) that underpins and perpetuates this ridiculous cultural dialectic. \n In the words of Nelson Mandela (as recently quoted by Barack Obama): \n ""No one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin or his background or his religion...""', 'Den var virkelig svaer at komme i gennem.

Perfect for 8th grade level', ""This series is drastically deteriorating. It's not that the story is that bad - on the contrary the story and the layout of jumping through the timeline kept me intrigued - but that I really did not like the writing. \n Exhibit A - Some examples of similes used were 'my heart dropped like a fossilised poo' and 'a heart as soft as yoghurt'. Please? \n Exhibit B - Putting speech in capital letters is cheating. It's text speak. There's a reason adverbs were invented. \n Exhibit C - If you're going to write a book in first person jumping around characters, they need to have an individual voice. They all sound so logical and perfect, especially Sephy's 'mother' voice. She sounds like a generic maternal character who would get about 5 speech lines in a book; she's meant to be the main character. \n Also, all the little sub-plots like Sephy's relationships were boring and stupid. However, this book's appeal comes from it's main story, but about 200 pages could have been easily dropped. \n If you've read the first 2, read it. Might as well. It's quick and easy.

Their effect on each others' lives will be explosive.,Tell_Me_No_Lies,"[""So as the blurb suggests the book follows Mike who is new in school; desperate to make friends, which he ultimately does, he finds himself at the wrath of Gemma. Gemma prefers to be invisible, pretending she is unseen and preferring to spend her time cutting out and collecting images of mothers. However when Gemma recognises Mike in one of her scrapbooks, she decides to use this too her advantage; blackmailing him and causing all sorts of emotional damage. The book spins between the two, who are both hiding secrets about their parents and themselves as this book looks at the danger of bullying, hatred, bribery and friendship all written in this authors compelling style. \n The writing is simple and basic, written for reader 11+ it needs to be to suit the reading age. The description is also less but it works to help push the plot along although it starts slowly. I liked the use of Gemma's controlling style despite her difficulty to fit in with the other students she has class with. It does feel a little dark in places, especially seen in Gemma's dominating and bulling fashion, but it also looks at why she is compelled to act in such a destructive way. She's lonely and tired of being the odd one out, which helps her become closer to her own family as a whole. I thought the tale of Mike, damaged by his abusive and aggressive father and the story of the day that they leave and his father dies was compelling and a strong contrast to Gemma's tale and both being estranged from their mother's helped to bring the two together. I thought the mystery surrounding the death of Mike's father and the location of his mother helped to add to the mystery. The ending wrapped up well and the development of characters is advanced well and they both grow as it continues; it's a compelling tale. \n My only wobble was that Gemma is quite unlikeable ( I know this is a main part of the story) but even in the ending she comes across a little terse. I think she could have blossomed more, but it's a minor point. Overall as I mentioned it's not as good as Noughts and Crosses and if you're looking for a book that's just as good you won't find it here. What you will find is well written book with a message. Pretty good."", ""More of a 3.5 ( I could never give any Malorie Blackman book less than that) \n Very quick read. I found the story to be a little bland and Gemma was an annoying character but both her and Mike do have a lot of depth to them which makes the story more interesting. Some nice twists as you begin to learn more and more about their pasts and learn new things with them. I do love the split points of view and Malorie Blackman's writing never fails to make me happy."", ""** spoiler alert ** \n This book was read as part of my English class. \n I went into this book feeling particularly optimistic about it. I mean, who wouldn't be- the blurb and first two or three chapters did enchant me a little. But I soon grew less and less fond of the book. \n Let's talk about characters, Gemma in particular. \n I did not like her in the slightest, which made for some very interesting class discussions. I mean, how old are the characters in this book exactly? Teenagers? 12 year olds? Gemma had he maturity of an eight or nine year old. Her empty threats of 'I'll tell everyone' quickly became tedious and boring. Literally, there was a collective eye roll throughout the group as she said this. I get that Blackman wanted to put it across that Gemma is the antagonist of the story, but it was very poorly executed. \n I had less problems with Mike. I pitied him mostly, and am surprised he didn't crack earlier on in the story. My only problem was with the terrible excuse of a plot twist in the last couple of chapters. Towards the end, he leaves school during lunchtime and Gemma chases him. They end up on a bridge, and he sits on the edge of the wall for some time, all while Gemma tells him 'not to do anything stupid'. Again, I understand that this scene was used to make Gemma realise her mistakes, but it was in no way realistic, and came across as over dramatic and anticlimactic. \n The plot twists in this book were also anticlimactic. There were that many scattered messily throughout the novel that nothing really came as a surprise. The only twist that had any effect on me personally was the moment when Gemma's father explained that her mother was alive but did not want her. Other than that, I found that every time something happened that was meant to change the plot, instead of a 'shock, horror!' Feeling, I was left with an 'oh, ok then' feeling. For example, when Mike told her that he killed his dad, both my friend and i wanted some sort of gruesome, bloody, cleverly crafted secret. But no. We were given 'I pushed him and he banged his head then i ran away.' Boring. \n Lastly, the ending seemed very rushed and also unlikely. After Gemma's behaviour, i feel that her classmates wouldn't be so quick to forgive. And also, the last few words didn't fit with the book at all. They left no impact, no desire to read more. It just ended very abruptly. \n All in all, I did not like this book. It is the first book by Mallorie Blackman that i have read, and it has no convinced me to read any more by her.""]",3.0,,,,

From his small-town beginnings to the top of the game, Henry finds out how hard it is to please his coach, his girl, and the sports page--and himself, too--all at once. Written in Henry's own words, this exuberant, funny novel follows his eccentric course from bush league to the World Series.

In his introduction to this edition, Mark Harris discusses the genesis of the novel in his own life experience.

Perhaps that's why I tend to enjoy the sport, as do most others in my family. This book looks like a kinda sweet take on it, with enough real-world anchoring to suit me. This one and the next one (which was made into a film) would be fun to catch up on."", 'I 1st read this book when I was about 15-16 years old. It was about baseball. That\'s all I needed to know. \n Since that time, I\'ve looked for this novel several times in different libraries. Never finding it until with my most recent library. It is part of a trilogy, with the more famous Bang the Drum Slowly being the more famous part of that trilogy. And, it has the reputation of being probably the most famous baseball trilogy in existence. For all I know, it might be the only baseball trilogy. \n At any rate, I was pleased to find it. More pleased than I was to have read it. Not that it\'s a bad book as it is not. But, written in 1st person and that person is a young ball player it\'s not the most attractively written book I\'ve ever read. But, it does tell a story of a young man growing up. It\'s just that he does it as the star left handed rookie pitcher for a major league baseball team. As that, it is a good book. It does that story well. \n Henry Wiggins is the baseball phenom in question. His ""Pop"" was a sandlot pitching legend and passes along his knowledge of the game, and pitching, to his son. And Henry soaked it all up as does a sponge. Hence, the phenom. He has a great fastball, a suitable curve and can pitch the occasional screwball to keep batters off their comfort zone. The baseball side of the story you can probably figure out by now. \n But, all in all, I did enjoy the story. Enough to finish this book even though it was printed in a smaller font than is comfortable for these old eyes. Also, enough to continue on in what, I understand now, has become a 4-part story. Bang the Drum Slowly is the next book in this 4-part trilogy(no idea what a 4-part story should be called) and probably, the other 2. Just not immediately. \n All in all, the book is not as good as I remembered. Remember that I was 15-16 in the 50\'s when I read it. But, it isn\'t as bad as I make it out to be here, either. So, I\'m looking forward to Bang the Drum Slowly. I\'ve seen that movie and I want to know if it happened like that.', 'What a great book. Great baseball writing that combines nuances and numbers of baseball as well as the increasing maturity and knowledge of our young main character.

Only old Stour, Master of the Library, realizes the importance of her quest. For Privet seeks an answer to moledom's final mystery: where and what is the Book of Silence, whose scribe nomole knows, whose content none can guess, whose existence many still doubt? Decades of harmony have passed since the brave moles of Duncton saved moledom's peaceful Stone followers from the disciples of the evil Word. But now all is not well. Their system has grown sleepy, while moledom is dangerously complacent about the spread of zealots from Caer Caradoc. Led by the sinister Thripp of Blagrove Slide, the Newborns believe that any other way than theirs to the Stone's Silence is blasphemy and deserves death. As the Caradocian moles gain power, shy Privet, aided by Stour and inspired by the strange and inarticulate Rooster, finds herself the agent of change and renewal in Duncton Wood.",Duncton_Tales,"[""If you like stories about animals but want something different, this is for you. Make no mistake, this is NOT a book for children. It has violence, sexual themes, bloodshed and swearing. It's also an excellent story about politics, religion and mysticism. The characters are rich and deep, as is the world they are written in."", 'This is the first book in the trilogy entitled The Book of Silence (and is followed by Duncton Rising and Duncton Stone). It is a continuation of the mole kingdom first explored in the Duncton Chronicles (Duncton Wood, Duncton Quest and Duncton Found) but newcomers to Horwood\'s cherished series about moles will find no difficulty in keeping up, since the events of the first three books are merely referenced in passing. \n In fact, time has moved on by about a century since the time of Duncton Found. In this book we follow the mole Privet, who, we find out in the course of the book, is the grand daughter of Wort, a character despised by many from the Duncton Chronicles. In this novel Privet seeks to hide from her past in the sanctuary of the library at Duncton Wood. \n She is taken in and accepted by moles, especially when she comes by circumstances strange to adopt the mole Whillan - whose birth and parentage are one of the mysteries still to be explored by the time we reach the last page. \n Unfortunately for Privet, she lives in momentous times. The sectarians known as the Newborn, who think they are the true believers of the Stone, are spreading across moledom and seeking to censor the libraries that they find. They are intimidating moles who believe of the Stone, and punishing them with sick religious rites known as \'massing\'. \n Woven into this story is the tale of when Privet was a younger mole, before her journey to Duncton Wood, and her love of Rooster, known to be Master of the Delve. \n The measure of how exciting a book is to me is how long it takes me to read - I have whipped through 600 page books in a day or so when moved by the writing. This tome took me ten days to wade through. I won\'t say that it was entirely dull, but the moments where the pace picked up from dogged and plodding were few and far between. \n I did like the fact that the Book of Tales mentioned by several moles in the book was actually reflected in Horwood\'s writing - we are reading a story within a story within a story here, and the flitting back and forth between past and present (and middle, I guess) keeps the pace up a little. \n The passages dealing with Privet and Rooster\'s love were by far the most intriguing (although I do wish he had a less ridiculous name than Rooster - we find out about halfway through the book that his name was given thanks to roosting crows, but by then I associated it with the more usual meaning of male chicken, which jarred a great deal!) We also meet some truly beloved and vivid characters during this period - including the five moles of the Delve and Rooster\'s friends Humlock and Glee. They are sensitively written and provide a dose of emotion to proceedings. \n This book suffers a great deal from being the first in a trilogy and trying to lay out events for the main story to pick up in the middle and last novel. There is a lot of scene setting, and nothing much happens (although I have a nasty fear, based on my reading of the first Duncton trilogy, that nothing much will happen in books two and three as well!) \n I disliked the pretentious tone Horwood took when it came to the Delving that Rooster was involved in (notice the capital letter to that word!) After all, we\'re just dealing with moles digging tunnels and it is very hard to attribute meaning and wonder to it - although Horwood asks us to. \n And once again we have heavy and overt religious overtones, which, frankly, do nothing to aid my enjoyment of the story. I know conflict is required to create a decent novel, but I could do without the preaching and the holier-than-thou attitude ascribed to believers of the Stone. And all the nonsense about seeking the Silence! Boring, I call it! \n So, I remain plodding my way through the Duncton series, wending my weary way to the no-doubt disappointing climax but with another 1,200 pages or so before I get there. These books are emblazoned with the bold words: ""More readable and rewarding than The Lord of the Rings"" - all I will say is ""Don\'t be fooled, people!""', ""I have a thing for animal stories. It is no doubt due to the fact that I read Watership Down at a very young age; I read the cover off that book. Most writers that get advertised as heirs to Richard Adams in the genre tend not to live up to the hype. Those that do, like Brian Jacques, tend to tell animal tales in a different way. \n William Horwood does and does not do this. \n This was the first Duncton book I ever read, even though it is the start of the second Duncton series. I brought when I was in Rotterdam, read it, loved it, and got everything I could find by Horwood before I left. \n While Watership Down is a quest tale with rabbits; the Duncton books tend to be more philospoic and religious (though it is hard to say what religion. Horwood, at least in the books, seems to be against forced conversion. There is a Buddist feeling, yet there are Christian overtones. Yet, the reader is not told to BELIEVE OR ELSE! It is more of this is what the moles believe, let's see how it plays out). Despite this thoughtful aspect of the book, there is plently of action. \n This book deals with belief and how belief can lead to censorship and control of infromation (can anyone else say South Park). Horwood really examines the agruments on both sides of the issue, and while he comes down on the side of freedom, his moles are aware of just points on the other side (for instance, why does the Duncton System get to keep the Holy Books of Moledom?). Because the moles are diggers, writers, and readers in some ways parts of the story feel like the debate over the Bible when it was first translated. \n At the heart of the story are two moles, neither of Duncton, though one, Privet, travels there. Privet and Rooster make an unlikely pair; he is a beast, but she is no beauty. Yet, despite the fact they are fiction and animals, the relationship, all of the relationships, are wonderfully drawn. \n Many adults wonder why they should read animal tales, believing that such stories are only for children. Take a look at Chaucer and his chickens, who had sex. Many adults have it wrong. In an adventure story about moles, Horwood gives a thoughtful look at faith and freedom without being preachy or annoying. He lets the characters do it, instead of speaking though the characters."", ""I think I'm Dunctoned-out. Just couldn't get into this.

I'm not entirely sure why; the two books have similarites but LOTR is a quest book, a physical quest book. The Duncton books are quest books, but in a totally different way. It isn't a physical quest, but one of the soul. Yes, this does also appear in LOTR, but LOTR is far more of a physical quest with an undercurrent of religion. The Duncton books deal with faith. Bad things happen, but the idea of failure that is present in LOTR is strangely absent. The Duncton moles do perform a quest, for silence. \n While some Christians in general, and Catholics in particular, might be upset by the protrayal of the Newborn sect in the first two books of this series, Horwood does not use a simplestic approach. He shows us that there something good in the Newborn sect, in particular though the reaction of beloved characters. Horwood does not go after faith in general; he presents a treatise about how something good can be perverted for something evil. \n Sounds timely and apt doesn't it?"", ""These Duncton books reach a new low.

I worry that the tagline comparing them with Watership Down will cause younger readers to pick them up. \n Here are the reasons they shouldn't: \n Overt torture scenes. \n Explicit mole sex scenes. \n At least two instances of rape, one involving a father towards his son. \n Disgustingly brutal fight scenes. \n A couple of really obscene death scenes. \n Avoid. Please.""]",2.0,,,,

Along with three friends, young Ned is swept up in one adventure after another as he accompanies the daring English mariner Francis Drake on amazing voyages of discovery across the Pacific. An eyewitness to the great naval battle between the English fleet and the Spanish Armada, Ned has firsthand views of England's rise as the world's most powerful sea-going nation.",Under_Drake_s_Flag,"['From a historical standpoint, I found the book very informative. From an entertainment standpoint, the book read more like a chronology of events and never gave a glimpse of the inner thoughts and back stories of the characters. Still, it was written in a different age and I did enjoy the overall story.', 'In the early 90s, I came into possession of what I took to be a very nearly complete collection (I have 75 volumes), mostly in first or other early editions, of the British writer G. A. Henty. Henty died in 1902 or thereabouts, having written his last books about the actions which took place in the war opposing English troops and Boer commandos. And that was his formula, first and foremost to record in print the historical events associated with any British military venture from the early Middle Ages onwards. The other characteristic of his writing was, that it was intended for consumption by boys and as such it was typical of a genre that was well developed in the late Victorian period. Henty\'s prefaces invariably start, ""My Dear Boys,"" and he developed a sort of intimacy with his youthful audience that eventually made him something of a best selling author at the end of last century. It is interesting to note that he is still in print, or was until very recently. \n Most of his books have a two-fold purpose therefore; recounting (mainly) military history and inculcating a certain notion of the standard of behaviour to be expected from a future young subaltern. No doubt, of the thousands of officers from British and colonial regiments who went to the front in 1915 and dashed themselves bravely against the German wall, a great many had had this form of early Henty training. Having read so many of them, one can scarcely recall the actual details of plots and sub-plots. Yet on the details of the history involved, there is much to learn, as Henty was a meticulous man who recorded as fully as possible (and some times too fully, it must be admitted, with respect to the endless movements of particular regiments into the line) the events he describes. He is equally good at sea as on land and has written some classics of maritime literature, particularly ""Under Drake\'s Flag,"" and ""Cochrane the Dauntless."" So while Henty can hardly be expected to have a wide audience today, for those who find him to their taste, it must be said that the material, most of which will have to be located second hand, is not wanting.', ""Listened to an audiodrama version. Good, like most Henty I've found."", ""This was excellent. It's very Jules Verne like. As his books were often adventures/travel novels, so is this book. It starts out like you think it begins. But it ends very very differently. It is quite a trip. I enjoyed it immensely I will be reading more in the series.""]",4.0,,,,

As she waits for and then rides on the subway train, she is careful not to fall or to move too quickly, but she still keeps moving, taking necessary risks and moving one step at a time. The watercolor illustrations are filled with surreal images and colors as they depict the woman moving steadily onward. I usually enjoy books that deal with journeys, whether they are literal or metaphoric, and this one was no exception to that enjoyment. Whether her journey is back home or to someone who cares about her or about reclaiming her life after being absent from it, the book sends a powerful message about recovery and embracing the joys of today. I loved the illustrations of topiary shapes, mazes, and the ones showing her ""going down against up,/ up against down"" (unpaged) as she sometimes seems to be heading against the masses of others. Readers will enjoy identifying characters from folktales in some of the subway scenes too. Although this book is more suited for adults than children, even youngsters can find something appealing in its pages. It is more likely to call to the adults in their lives, though.', ""Visually this is one of the most captivating and imaginative books I have ever read.

So, she took the subway, with the company of a little dog, and stopped by different stations. In the course of her exploration, she wondered and pondered a lot as she was on the subway. She wanted to feel falling golden leaves, pick and taste apples, play with dolphins, fly in the sky, and listen to the sound of the colors she can\'t see. What\'s more, what she wanted to find was ""...where I am and where I\'m going"" (unpaged). Originally written in Chinese, The Sound of Colors is adapted in English while still containing Jimmiy Liao\'s poetic and philosophical way of storytelling. The delicate watercolor illustrations show the detailed textures of objects such as trees, leaves, and walls.

The dwarves are going on a quest to reclaim their home, the Lonely Mountain. But there's a problem, the Lonely Mountain is home to, Smaug the Magnificent, a fierce gold loving dragon. Smaug stole the mountain from the dwarves years beforehand. Bilbo is appointed to be the dwarves' burglar.

The ring comes in very handy when the dwarves are taken prisoner by the elves of Mirkwood, and especially when he has to enter the Lonely mountain. \n The story makes the ordinary things of life seem much more magical.

Children start to count long before they learn their ABC's, for they are constantly comparing and classifying things and events they observe around them. As they try to bring sense and order into what they observe, they are actually performing basic mathematical feats.<br /><br />In this book, Mitsumasa Anno, the creator of the brilliantly inventive Anno's Alphabet, invites young readers on another stimulating adventure of the imagination-this time into the world of numbers and counting. Gentle watercolor pictures show a landscape changing through the various times of day and the turning seasons, months and years, and the activities of the people and animals who come to live there. But the seemingly simple plan of the book is deceptive: look more carefully and you will see one-to-one correspondences; groups and sets; scales and tabulations; changes over time periods; and many other mathematical relationships as they occur in natural, everyday living. Just as our forebears developed our number system from observing the order of nature, the reader is subtly led to see and understand the real meaning of numbers.<br /><br />Look at this book and look again. Each time you do so, you will find another application of a natural mathematical concept that you had not noticed before.",Anno_s_Counting_Book,"[""I can't five-star this book enough. My two and a half year old is totally embracing numeracy with wonder as he absorbs this book. I want to own every Anno book there is, he's a monkey genius.

Then pick up a copy of Anno\'s Counting Book. This wordless picture book starts with the number 0 and, spread by spread, counts up to twelve. There is just so much to love about this book! \n First of all, I have to say that I appreciate the fact that it goes through 12. The vast majority of counting books stop at 10 but Anno works through a full dozen. And he illustrates zero. Zero really isn\'t the easiest concept for a preschooler to grasp but Anno gives them the chance to learn what it means. \n Furthermore, Anno acknowledges the abstract nature of numbers. What do I mean by abstract nature? Draw a picture of an apple and show it to your young reader and if you have even minimal talent, your child will recognize the apple. Why? Because it looks like an apple. Write out ""3"" or ""5"" and your reader isn\'t going to know that 3 means three of something and that 5 stands for two more than that. Numbers are not concrete, but abstract. \n Without any words, Anno demonstrates each number in three different ways. Each is written out in terms of Arabic numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) and as groups of blocks (1-10 per column). The illustrations show the number in question in several different ways -- 1 building, 1 snow man, 1 pine tree, 1 skier. Although 2 shows 2 buildings, 2 men, 2 trucks, 2 pine trees and more, not everything in the painting appears as part of a pair. There is still only one river and one bridge. Children have a chance to see what 2 is and what 2 is not. \n Although the book is wordless, the illustrations do tell a story as a village grows from late one winter through the middle (Christmas) of the next winter. As the seasons pass, the village adds building after building and the numbers of people and heads of livestock grow. \n Pick this book up and share it with your young learner. Then be ready to go out and find the various numbers in the larger world. \n Originally reviewed at The Bookshelf (https://suebe2.wordpress.com/2016/03/...).', ""I need to do more Anno posts because these books ARE my childhood. I was having a conversation the other day about not really being able to remember reading picture books with my mom, but I can remember the hours upon hours I spent with Anno. The counting book starts with 1 being the month of January and it goes up to 12 so that you complete a calendar year. You watch the seasons change and you watch this one landscape develop. The detail of the pictures and the fact that everything comes in the right number will keep kids looking for more especially at the end. Just Anno's style in general has always been something I've loved. The simplicity yet detail."", 'my mom was a teacher so she was able to get discounts to a lot of products and books so every month, my mom got me monthly cheap and I was able to get a lot of books as a kid and I felt lucky', ""Anno's Counting Book by Mitsumasa Anno is a wonderful counting book for children. The illustrations and complete lack of text allow children to learn how to count on their own. Each page is presented as a picture of a growing town, with one side of the page housing counting blocks and the other the written numeral for the page. So, for example, the first page shows an empty, snowy field with the number zero on the left hand side of the page and an empty nest for counting blocks on the right. As the reader progresses through the book, the numbers get larger, more blocks get added, and more building are added to our town. We also get to watch the seasons change whilst our town grows. The back page of the book is an explanation of counting which could prove particularly useful to a teacher wanting to integrate Anno's Counting Book into their curriculum. The beautiful illustrations are what make this book and what carries young learners forward and on to learning more and more about counting. All in all, Anno's Counting Book could be a great asset in a classroom to begin to teach students how to count or just as a book in your personal library for your own children to begin to familiarize themselves with numbers."", ""Great book that engages readers (both adult and child) by encouraging them to count the beautiful, simple illustrations on each page. Starting from 0 and ending at 12, each layout features buildings or houses, trees and flowers, people, animals and so on from a village. The number of objects/people/animals grows chronologically. It's fun to look at the small illustrations and count them in groups. This pushes the reader to really engage with the book and the act of counting. The last page of the group explains how this is an excellent method to get kids counting and taught me a lot about this process and thinking about numbers and math.

Area for comment: Illustrations \n B. The correspondence between the number and visual illustrations are precisely depicted, allowing the reader to understand the concept of counting on a greater level. Anno slashes the abstract notion of counting by using two types of visual representations, the drawings of the houses as well as the cubical representation to allow the concept to resonate in a more appropriate manner with the reader. \n C. The first image of nothing clearly represents the number zero and with the turn of a page, the reader is then able to see the number one, along with the visual concept of the number one through the drawing of a single house. With each consecutive page the number of houses increases, thus corresponding with the orderly fashion of the concept of counting. \n Curriculum connection: I would use this with younger audiences, preschool and Kindergarten mostly since that is the age when children are most interested in counting and learning their numbers. I also believe ESL students would also benefit from the counting concept within this text.', 'Anno\'s approach to numbers is simple but brilliant. Each double page shows a scene in the countryside with items in the scene that match the number tile on the page. We have the numerical symbol, a cube, and the items in the picture - three ways to understand the number. When we get past 10, the cubes befin a new stack alongside to match with our teaching of ""tens"". This is a classic that does not dumb down like other counting books may, instead giving the child leeway to draw his or her own conclusions.', ""This is my favorite kind of book for children - wordless!!! The Anno books have tons of illustrations, lots to notice and talk about, AND lots to count! Counting is especially fun (and highlighted) in this book. Children count to 12, and don't want to stop counting."", ""Anno's Counting Book offers children twelve pages of pictures with various things to count on each page like on page two it has two men, two trucks, two trees and two children. Each page has the number and blocks to the side of the picture illustrating the number and then the children can find as many of that number on each page as they can from one to twelve. I like that the children are given an opportunity to go beyond ten, where often preschool children stop counting. This challenges them and expands their knowledge, practices counting and number sense and one-to-on number relationships.""]",17.0,,,,

Most importantly, give it to yourself. It will help you remember why you loved reading in the first place.",What_the_Dormouse_Said,"['Often it is stated ""out of the mouth of babes"". We forget the profound wisdom that is found in the pages of children\'s literature. After picking up this little book I am inspired to go out and pick up some of those classics again.', 'Children\'s books are often dismissed as a lesser form of literature when compared to books aimed at adult audiences. However, children\'s literature often contains universal truths that can benefit readers of all ages. \n What the Dormouse Said: Lessons for Grown-ups from Children\'s Books, is a charming collection of literary quotations. Amy Gash first became interested in children\'s books after the birth of her son. She began to seek out good children\'s books after her son was old enough to request the same story over and over again. This was an act of self-preservation, one to which many parents can relate. Ms. Gash soon found that not only was she reading children\'s books to her son; she was also reading them for her own enjoyment. Along the way, she was able to glean wisdom for adult living from these tales intended for children. \n The book covers subjects such as love and friendship, imagination, wisdom, courage, acceptance, nature, character and individuality, growing old and hidden truths. The quotations are from a wide variety of sources: Charlotte\'s Web, Mary Poppins, The Water-Babies, Ella Enchanted, The Little Prince, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, Goodnight Moon, The Velveteen Rabbit, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone and Sarah, Plain and Tall; just to name a few. There are wonderful illustrations by Pierre Le-Tan interspersed throughout the book. \n I read many of the books quoted in What the Dormouse Said as a child, more of them as an adult, and have discovered many titles that were new to me that I will seek out in the future. It\'s a delightful book for anyone who enjoys children\'s literature. \n I\'d like to close my review by sharing some of my favorite quotations from What the Dormouse Said with you: \n ""Each thing she learned became part of herself, to be used over and over in new adventures."" -Gypsy, Kate Seredy \n ""Grownups sure do a lot of pretending and call it politeness."" -Miss Charity Comes to Stay, Alberta Wilson Constant \n ""You saved me once, and what is given is always returned. We are in this world to help one another."" -The Adventures of Pinocchio, C. Collodi \n ""The Dormouse sulkily remarked, \'If you can\'t be civil, you\'d better finish the story for yourself.\'"" -Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll', 'I have not read the majority of the books that were quoted, however, this is a nice collection of quotes. There were a few familiar ones, some good and bad ones, but overall an interesting book to read. It made me wish I had kept a notebook of quotes I have liked over the years from the books I have read. I may start doing that now.']",3.0,,,,

He became fascinated with issues of the Century largely devoted to famous battles &amp; Civil War military leaders. Frustrated with dryly written stories, he stated, ""I wonder that some of those fellows don't tell how they felt in those scraps. They spout enough of what they did, but they're as emotionless as rocks."" Eventually the idea of writing a war novel overtook him. He would later state that he ""had been unconsciously working the detail of the story out thru most of his boyhood"" &amp; had imagined ""war stories ever since he was out of knickerbockers.""<br /> During an unnamed battle, 18-year-old private Henry Fleming survives what he considers to be a lost cause by escaping into a nearby wood, deserting his battalion. He finds a group of injured men in which one of the group, the ""Tattered Soldier"", asks Henry, who's often referred to as ""The Youth"", where he's wounded. Henry, embarrassed that he's whole, wanders thru the forest. He ultimately decides that running was the best thing, &amp; that he's a small part of the army responsible for saving himself. When he learns that his battalion had won the battle, Henry feels guilty. As a result, he returns to his battalion &amp; is injured when a cannon operator hits him in the head because he wouldn't let go of his arm. When he returns to camp, the other soldiers believe he was harmed by a bullet grazing him in battle. The next morning he goes into battle for a 3rd time. While looking for a stream from which to attain water, he discovers from the commanding officer that his regiment has a lackluster reputation. The officer speaks casually about sacrificing Henry's regiment because they're nothing more than ""mule drivers"" &amp; ""mud diggers"". With no regiments to spare, the general orders his men forward. In the final battle, Henry becomes one of the best fighters in his battalion as well as the flag bearer, finally proving his courage as a man.",The_Red_Badge_of_Courage,"['I read this book in high school. The edition we read also featured other Crane stuff after the end of the novel. Poems, and ""Maggie, a Girl of the Streets"" among other things. I don\'t remember that much except for the poem about the guy eating his own heart. The worse-for-wear edition(Pocket Library - 1958) I\'m reading now is the one pictured, which comes with a very nice bio/intro. SC\'s life and career bear some resemblance to that of John Keats\': careless, energetic, youthful literary genius loses his life to consumption a too early an age. Sad ... \n - Last night I went from ""The Odyssey"" to this. Right off the bat we read of the youth\'s head containing images of ""Greeklike"" structures and Homeric tales. And then SC puts in some Homeric imagery of his own - neat! War and Sex(the girl in the window)!!! \n Reading this is like a breath of fresh air. Very eye-opening, though I have read ""The Open Boat"" and ""The Blue Hotel"" fairly recently. Both are amazingly modern. Henry James and SC were friends in England. Crane is like the anti-James in his writing style! \n ""The skirmishers in advance fascinated him. Their shots into thickets and at distant and prominent trees spoke to him of tragedies - hidden, mysterious, solemn."" - mysterious indeed! Psychology and poetry blended together ... \n Now well into the first skirmish, the next one and the running, the forest, the man/vision in the forest, the strange fates of the tall man and the tattered man. I think it\'s very important to read as closely as possible to grasp Crane\'s achievement here. SO far ahead of his time ... and reminiscent of ""Madame Bovary"" in it\'s detachment. Crane makes this happen by isolating the youth and those he encounters in a kind of dreamlike setting. This is supposedly based on Chancellorsville, but it really matters not at all. It\'s a universal, psychological thing ... \n - as in ""The Odyssey"" we get a wanderer from battle, but this time NOT heroic at all. \n - phrases that Crane likes: ""pacing to and fro"" - it\'s here and in ""The Open Boat""(last sentence). \n - The tall soldier\'s story is VERY reminiscent of Snowden\'s in ""Catch-22"" - particularly at the very end. In fact there\'s a general connection here between the two books. \n Finished last night as the youth becomes a better man in every way. He moves through immature cluelessness and callow self-preservation and avoidance to a humble acceptance. He even does a searching and fearless moral inventory(step four) and comes to understand how he failed the tattered soldier. I was wondering about that ... Seems like the whole thing is about dealing with life itself. The warfare described by S. Crane is an intense(putting it mildly) metaphor for adult life. The prose was consistently simple, yet challenging, interesting and poetic and the battle scenes seemed real enough to me. Interesting to read this book while I\'m reading about the 14th century, a time during which it seems like war was constant, but different. A more modern, capitalist and wealthy society can support/afford a more catastrophic conflict. Stephen Crane was only 22 when he wrote this and at times it shows but overall it\'s an amazing work. The second half of the book is devoted to one whole day in hell, with a bit of golden(NOT red) hope at the end of it. \n - the print changes in size from one page to another! \n - Crane-prose = a paragraph: ""Other me, punched by bullets, fell in grotesque agonies. The regiment left a coherent trail of bodies."" So ... what does ""coherent"" mean?????? \n - 4.75* rounds up to 5*', 'A great anti-war novel.', ""Red Badge of Courage is a descriptive narration of one youth's first battle experience during the Civil War. This book deals with a dark time in American History and the writer treats it as such. The detail is stark, bleak and Crane doesn't sugar coat anything. \n I'm not disappointed that I finally picked this up and read it. It is a very short novel and doesn't take much of a time commitment to read. I did however find it dragging in parts and it took me a while to get into it. Henry, the youth, of the novel is a fairly simple individual who is shown the ugly face of war and his reactions to his first experiences are what the book is about. \n All in all, this is a good book, but nowhere near great. I'm not a big fan of Crane's style in his storytelling, however he does paint a vivid picture and the reader gets a clear idea of what it may have been like to be an unwitting youth going into battle for the first time with little training or warning of what to expect.""]",3.0,,,,

I take it back. Compared to Farmer in the Sky, Piper\'s work was visionary. In Farmer we have microwave ovens, easy space travel, and mass-to-energy conversion technology, but we also have a teenager who plays accordion and cribbage, works hard on his merit badges, and thinks girls are yucky. I\'ve enjoyed Heinlein\'s juveniles in the past, though I\'ve never been one of those who worshiped at his altar (I always preferred Asimov or Clarke). I think this book may have put me off of him forever, since about halfway through it the theme to The Andy Griffith Show started playing in my head and wouldn\'t stop. All done now. Next! \n I can\'t go as low as 1 star because the book does have a few good bits, just not enough to redeem it. The central theme of colonization being hard, backbreaking work is strong and well-presented, though the lack of ground transportation on the colony was hard to swallow. The earthquake disaster and planetary freeze is compelling and, if you could remove it from the larger context, would have made a great short story. \n Throughout, though, we get Heinlein in preachy mode with a Mary Sue protagonist and other characters who fall into the categories of Wise Men Who Are Never Wrong and straw men for Heinlein to attack.

Treasure Island is one of these books. My initial reason to pick up the book was to do a character study of the ambiguous Long John Silver but being pressed for time, I found a free audiobook on iTunes and started listening at work. I always feel like I am cheating on books when I listen instead of reading, but I excused myself this time. As I began listening to the book at work, a sense of excitement took hold of me. I felt like a young reader again and wanted to drink up every ounce of Stevenson\'s words. After listening to the first two chapters of the audiobook, I stopped listening and checked the actual book out of the library later that week. The narration was fantastic but the language was even better and I couldn\'t help but wish, as I listened, that I was reading the words on a printed page. \n Treasure Island is a typical adventure story. It is also where many pirates tropes originated. I couldn\'t believe how much the Pirates of the Caribbean films borrowed from this book! The films certainly carry a similar spirit that makes you want more and more and more! Our main character is Jim Hawkins who runes an inn with his parents by the sea. He lives an ordinary life until a pirate named Bill arrives and Jim\'s life becomes extraordinary. When a group of pirates raid the inn, Jim and his mother must flee. Before they leave they find a mysterious treasure map. When Jim shows the map to some comrades, they make haste to find a ship and set sail to Treasure Island! \n This book was very exciting. It had a lot of twists and turns and was very different from the various adaptions I have seen via the big and small screen. As the story moved forward I grew more and more tired of the...story. I really loved the beginning but the end felt very rushed but perhaps that was because I was reading faster to try and finish the book. Long John Silver is definitely an interesting character though I really love our main character, Jim. I can imagine many young boys inspired to have adventures and bravery like him when this book was first published. The writing was impeccable, there is no denying that. Overall, it wasn\'t the amazing book I had expected but it was a good read and I\'m glad that I have finally read it so that I will hopefully notice other works that borrow from the tale. I will give it 3 out of 5 stars.']",2.0,,,,

It's particularly odd to read about a family who lives in New York City who have a house and a yard and who are decidedly not rich. \n This book feels less like a whole book to me now and more like an introduction to the family who one comes to adore over the next two books. It's a capsule, a moment, and a series of character sketches. All of the characters are interesting but it's the barest hint of what comes next, how we come to know them in The Four Story Mistake and Then There Were Five.

They form a club dedicated to this purpose, and name it the Independent Saturday Afternoon Adventure Club, or I.S.A.A.C. Each chapter of the book covers a different Saturday, as the reader follows each child to his or her chosen activity. \n The concept of this book is wonderful, and it's what grabbed my attention in the first place. But a good portion of it was spoiled for me because adults kept stealing the spotlight! At least two of the chapters digress into long-winded stories told by secondary characters the kids meet on their adventures, thus robbing me of the enjoyment of seeing kids on their own in the streets of New York City, something that would be just plain unsafe nowadays. I wished so much that the kids had actually been more independent. \n For the most part, I enjoyed the old-fashioned feeling of this book, and the writing style really appealed to me. The only thing that bothered me was that Elizabeth Enright was very fond of similes and metaphors, and after a while, I felt like I was tripping over them. I also thought they reminded me of the author's presence too often. Figures of speech cropped up no matter whose point of view we were supposed to be in, and they all sounded like they came from the same voice. \n The tail-end of the book is really great, though. Oliver gets a chance to have his own Saturday, and being in his six-year-old mind is a definite treat.

There was no way a man who behaved like Paul at the beginning of the book will behave like the Paul at the end of the book. It\'s like it is not the same man, and there are no logical explanation for his former behaviour and his behaviour in the second half of the book. If Paul had been less of a cruel sadistic jerk at the beginning, then I could have understood his behaviour at the end. \n Apart from, that I was mostly OK with everything. I think the terrible consequences of the behaviour of Joey\'s mother was very well done. This really is a clever book I enjoyed very much.', 'This was a really nice story. There were a couple of things that had me shaking my head A toddler being that still for long periods of time? The banter back and forth between Ben, Joey and James... a 15 year old kid... in regards to the sex sounds that Joe and Ben make at night. And then there\'s the creepiness of Joey and Ben talking about how ""hot"" James\' new boyfriend is and one comment is even made in regards to how ""hot"" it would be to see James and Jared hook up... sure, it was said jokingly but the entire story is based on Joey\'s family saying that homosexuality is an abomination and that James living with Joey and Ben would make James turn ""that way"". Some even made comments in regards to gay men being all about wanting to hook up with young boys... this was mainly aimed at Ben who supposedly corrupted poor Joey. The point of the story was to prove all of that otherwise so I found it kind of creepy when those comments were made even if they weren\'t said in seriousness. but overall it was very good. \n The dialogue got to be a bit much at times. It drives me nuts when characters refer to the person they are talking to by name in every single sentence. Every time Joey said something (it seemed like) it was ""Ben this..."" or ""Ben that..."" It was the same when Ben was speaking to Joey. Don\'t get me wrong, sometimes it was quite necessary because pretty much the entire 500-something pages are dialogue so it helped to keep from getting confused but it can definitely be too much. \n The story was actually quite good. It takes awhile to get to the resolution but the resolution is satisfactory. I was getting toward the end almost scared of how one character\'s attitude would be dealt with. I had this fear that after all the stuff with Vinnie that the author would make him suddenly change and become accepting and then tie that particular part of the story in a nice, neat bow. That would have angered me. Not everything is tied up neatly but the story plays out well. The cast of characters are interesting to say the least. Throughout most of it I was thinking how thankful I am that I don\'t have a family like Joey\'s... :) And I thought MY mother-in-law was bad. Not! One character in particular, while an important part of the story, could never redeem himself in my eyes. He is written as a complete tool in the very beginning and then suddenly he becomes a friend of sorts. I had a difficult time seeing him for anything other than the way he was described early on even if he did do something nice later. \n There is conflict, lots of homophobic idiots, questions about ones sexuality and even a troubled teen but in the end it is a very nice love story. Definitely worth the time it took for me to read it.', 'I really liked this book (the storyline and the characters) but there were a few things that bugged me. \n 1. There were long sections of dialogue with no narration whatsoever. Narration would have made it easier and more enjoyable to read. \n 2. The characters kept saying each others\' names (i.e. ""Well, Bob, I\'m not sure how I\'m going to solve this problem""). People don\'t talk like that in real life. You may say someone\'s name to get his/her attention, but generally not in the middle of talking. \n 3. I know Ben and Joey had a lot of outside problems (family) but they had almost no disagreements between themselves, which just seemed unrealistic.', 'Dobrotnoe, skuchnovatoe chtivo.', ""Ben is a bit insecure, very gay and overall amazing. Joey is new to everything involving the same equipment, but incredibly accepting and down to earth despite all the sh*t he has to go through to be happy. \n I loved Ben's support and the happy feel with which he relaxed into the relationship despite his past. And I loved the way Joey just took it all in stride, being thankful for another chance in life and not intending to let it slip through his fingers. \n It's a story about a big Italian family and a lot of closed off opinions that come with religion opposed to a few loving and accepting members with a completely different background. It really is a fun read, very emotional at times but completely adorable at others. \n Definitely something I would recommend."", '4.5 Stars, Great free read!', ""I absolutely loved this book. It is written in 1st person, which I typically don't like because you only get one pov. However, this is written in both the main characters' pov, switching within each chapter. There was some overlap, but it was nice to see it through another set of eyes. \n The book is about Joey and Ben; their first meeting, their friendship, them falling in love and all of the things they have to deal with. There is a full cast of secondary characters (more than most books), but it does not get confusing or make the reader feel like it's too much. It was also very real. There wasn't action or adventure, just a story of two guys falling in love and dealing with the things life throws at them. \n One of the things I really loved about this book was that it was long. Most of the time I get to end of a book and I feel dissatisfied, like ordering a great salad and only getting a bowl of lettuce. You get some sustenance, but it leaves you wanting so much more. In this book you get to meet the characters and learn to love them. Yes, I want more, but I am okay with where it ended and I feel like I got a full taste of their story rather than a nibble. \n If I can find anything else by this author, I will surely read it."", ""I really enjoyed this read overall. The story developed very nicely, wasn't rushed at all and just felt very real. \n But you notice that it never went through professional editing with some of the dialogues feeling a bit forced. \n I also found it a bit annoying how they really spelt out every feeling, talking about EVERYTHING that was going on which I didn't like because it was just a bit much, mainly because most times their motivations and feelings were already obvious and really didn't need to be voiced in that much detail. \n But apart from that it really was a nice book I really enjoyed and would recommend""]",8.0,,,,

Dina si e appena trasferita, mentre Chelsea ha avuto la mononucleosi e entrambe iniziano l\'ultimo anno con un mese di ritardo. Chelsea in apparenza ha la vita perfetta, circondata da mille amici, super popolare, ricca, ben voluta da tutti. Dina e l\'ultima arrivata e se nella vecchia scuola era circondata dagli amici, qui si ritrova da sola a dover confrontarsi con una realta che non accetta la sua diversita. Le cose cambieranno quando entrambe si troveranno a dover collaborare per un progetto per l\'anniversario della scuola. Progetto che sara il fulcro su cui si sviluppera tutto il racconto. La vita, quella vera, non e mai quella che sembra e ha sempre mille sfumature che vanno interpretate. Nonostante le iniziali difficolta scopriranno di essere piu vicine di quello che credevano. \n Diversi sono i particolari che fanno amare questo libro. Innanzitutto il fatto che in qualche modo e tutto perfettamente realistico, si ha a che fare con preadolescenti, a tredici anni inizi a staccarti dalla famiglia, a fare le tue esperienze a prenderti le prime cotte, ma sei ancora in qualche modo legato a certe abitudini infantili. C\'e sempre la solita divisione tra i popolari e gli sfigati, i ricchi e i meno ricchi, i fashion e i fuori moda, mischiati in un contesto che non e quello dell\'high school ma che comunque lo anticipa in pieno. \n Le dinamiche sono le stesse ma qui in qualche modo c\'e altro.

Chelsea non ha la vita perfetta anzi va tutto a rotoli, Dina si rivela meno preoccupata del giudizio degli altri e molto piu incline a vivere tutto cosi come viene. \n Le perfide migliori amiche di Chelsea Molly e Kendall offrono l\'antagonismo perfetto, come pure Ross il re della scuola che alla fine sceglie il meno ovvio, e Sasha Preston che sembra un personaggio secondario e invece fa la differenza perche e davvero capace di unire le due ragazze e mostrare loro che cosa significa davvero vivere una vita al di fuori delle convenzioni.

Dina has recently moved to town, and must deal with the fact that the qualities that made her popular in her old school are the same qualities that make her unpopular in her new school. Chelsea, in the meantime, has started school a month late, thanks to a bout with mono, and she's hiding a secret about her family that she is convinced will ruin her own popularity. The girls are thrown together by a well-meaning teacher who assigns them to work together on a video celebrating the school's upcoming fiftieth anniversary. Dina sees this as an opportunity to make a new friend, while Chelsea worries what it will do to her reputation. \n What I liked most about this book is its focus on an unusual relationship. Typically, books in this genre involve a girl, her best friend, and her male love interest. At the heart of this book, though, is an unwanted alliance and a real enmity between two girls who might not necessarily be compatible, or want to become friends. Because the book comes at middle school from this unique angle, the story is able to explore emotions and experiences other than the typical best friend and boyfriend interactions. From chipping, the school's hazing method, whereby potato chips are crumbled into an unpopular student's backpack, to Chelsea's realization that her friends might not care as much about her as they do about her money and status, Greenwald demonstrates a real understanding of the intricacies of middle school politics, and how difficult they can be to navigate. \n Unfortunately, though I love the premise, it was hard for me to click with this book. I liked the characters, but it didn't feel like enough happened to them to keep me interested for the duration of the entire novel. I was especially bogged down by the continuous references to the girls' procrastination. It seemed like more than half of their interactions involved the same conversation - Dina wanted to work on the project, but Chelsea had better things to do. There was also the additional element of trying to track down a TV star who went to their middle school, which was interesting, but took a long time to build up to. I would have liked to see more minor conflicts to keep things moving in between the main events of the story. \n Girls in grades 5 to 8 will enjoy seeing their own middle school dramas brought to life in this story. Budding filmmakers and actors will also enjoy the film-related scenes, and the behind-the-scenes tour of a TV set."", 'weird but ok', 'I really enjoyed reading this book. I would recommend it to middle-schoolers and people who like to read realistic fiction/contemporary stories.', ""This book would be more for middle-graders since, the setting of story takes place in middle school. Even though I'm older than the girls in the story, I actually enjoyed reading the story. I brought back memories of my time in middle school. Lisa Greenwald is a wonderful writer. There were moments of surprise, laughter, and sometimes heartfelt, all bringing a great story of growing up. Too bad I didn't have a book like this when I was in middle school. \n The story is told in two points of view, Dina and Chelsea, both girls who attend at Rockwood Hills Junior High. They are very different. Dina may seem outgoing, artsy, and not care about anything, but inside she does, she only appears to be free-minded, and smile at everything. Chelsea appears to be the girl with the perfect life, the most popular girl in school, but in reality, her family is struggling with financial problems. These two very different girls get teamed up to do a video about the school, for a big event. \n They have a lot of struggles trying to finish the project. There are so many distractions. Chelsea is afraid of losing her friends once her secret is out. Dina is worried about making friends. But deep down, this story should be for any middle grader, because it shows how many people are actually different than they appear to be. They have stories and secrets of their own, just needing a push to show who they really are. \n There were slow parts, and then some exciting parts, for overall enjoyable read. I really love the video tips and Sasha Preston pieces of advice, which worth both great advice to keep in mind. \n -Sarah"", ""Dina was part of the popular crowd at her previous school, but when her parents move her to Long Island from her small town in Massachusetts she starts out as the weird new girl at a much larger middle school.

She's hoping to maintain her status with the popular kids, but once she starts working on the video project with Dina she finds herself more and more intrigued by her quirky personality. Chelsea is torn between two things, maintaining her popularity and befriending the new girl. This dilemma is made more difficult by her need to hide her secret. \n While I'm in the minority, and loved Junior High, this was a great book showing both the struggles of middle school and starting to find your place in the world. I could sympathize with Chelsea as I had a lot of the same issues (my Dad lost his job and I befriended the new kid! *lol* ) And I think Lisa Greenwald did a great job of making you empathize with both girls. \n I really enjoyed this quick read and give it 3 hearts"", 'Have you ever felt like The New Kid ?

I came from a family who for some reason or another loved to move not only houses but also towns, so I\'ve had plenty of experience at being the new girl and more often than not - it isn\'t really a great experience. \n In Reel Life Starring Us we meet Dina - she\'s the New Girl, at her old school she was the popular one and now starting at a school formed with cliques and close-knit family and friends - she has gone from Hero to Zero and if her day\'s as being the New Girl doesn\'t suck as much - what makes matters worse is that she is continually being ""chipped"".

However as we are about to read and learn, appearances can be fooling as underneath Chelsea\'s popular exterior lies a girl whose life day by day is falling apart. \n Will Chelsea and Dina bond over their problems or when their video starts to be known will Chelsea and Dina find themselves living in a Rockwood Hills Junior High Reality show , where everything you see is not always the truth ? \n Find out all this and more in Lisa Greenwald\'s new Junior High novel ""Reel Life Starring Us"" - a great read for all those tween and teens interested in Reality TV and novels like Lisi Harrison\'s The Clique series.', ""Artsy Dina Gross used to be one of the most popular girls in her school, but that was before she moved to a new town, where quirkiness is not appreciated.

What she doesn't know is that Chelsea's once-perfect life is crumbling, and it's about to take Chelsea with it. \n Told from alternating perspectives, this is a fun, quick story of two very different girls coming to terms with who they are and learning to become friends. While some of the lessons on popularity and self-acceptance are a bit heavy-handed, and the characters often sound much older than thirteen, Reel Life Starring Us should resonate with many middle school girls who are, themselves, learning who they are and where they fit in socially."", 'This is the first Greenwald novel I have read and I did like it. It is certainly a positive book for girl middle-readers. The basic plot line is predictable: new girls moves into school, popular girl is paired with her on a project, popular kids mock new girl, new girl and popular girl partner forge a friendship, new girls finds better friends than the popular snobs. That being said...the dialogue is great, characters accurate and the ending totally worked for me.', ""GREENWALD, Lisa. Reel Life Starring Us. 294p. Amulet Books. Sept 2011.

A century on, it is clear that this collection of humorous, lyrical and delicately evocative tales had a profound influence on children's literature. Rather than idolising childhood, Dream Days is, as Julia Eccleshare says in her introduction, 'a celebration of the imaginative play of children which sets them apart from adults and empowers them at a time when, within the realities of their lives, they are largely powerless'.<br /><br />In 'The Twenty-first of October', Selina, a devoted admirer of Nelson, attempts to celebrate Trafalgar Day by lighting a bonfire - with disastrous consequences. In 'The Walls Were as of Jasper' the child-narrator escapes a dull visit to a neighbour's house by losing himself in the pictures of a beautiful book: 'Pictures never lied, never shuffled nor evaded; and as for the story, I could invent it myself '. 'The Reluctant Dragon' tells of the friendship between a little boy and a gentle, poetry-writing dragon, who has made his home in the Berkshire Downs and is blissfully unaware of the alarm his presence has caused in the local village. It is up to the little boy to make sure that the imminent arrival of St George does not spell destruction for his new friend.<br /><br />Dream Days is written from the point of view of an adult looking back, and captures the frustrations of children faced by adults who have 'forgotten what it is like to be young'. Whether playing at pirates, inventing imaginary realms, visiting the circus or simply squabbling ferociously among themselves, the five children are vividly and convincingly portrayed. Enchanting illustrations by Debra McFarlane make this edition one to be cherished.",dream-days,"['Fra den gyldne tidsalder for bornelitteratur kommer her en af genrens mestre og hans vidunderlige noveller. Kenneth Grahame skildrer pa fantastisk og meget humoristisk vis livet set fra en victoriansk soskendefloks synsvinkel. Grahame har en fantastisk greb pa hans bornekarakterer, og placerer de unavngivne voksne karakterer meget smart pa et andet plan med begrebet ""The Olympians"", som fortaelleren bliver ved med at bruge om dem. Altsa at de voksne i deres liv er som fjerne guder pa Olympus, som en gang i mellem blander sig i bornenes liv... for det meste imod deres vilje. \n Jeg var isaer glad for klassikeren The Reluctant Dragon, som ogsa nemt kan findes udgivet selvstaendig og er den mest kendte af novellerne, og October 21st, som er en lidt rorende hyldest til bade Trafalgar Day (og Lord Nelson). ""A Departure"" er ogsa en vidunderlig naermest victoriansk udgave af Toy Story. \n Alt i alt har den her vaeret en ren nydelse af laese... og nok snart genlaese.', 'http://cdnbookworm.blogspot.ca/2015/0...']",2.0,,,,

It\'s hard to argue that any two good buddies could be much sweeter together than the standby pairs (or is that ""pears""? ;-) described in this book. Have you ever had a pal who\'s as good with you as hot chocolate is with marshmallows, or cookies with milk? Who blends with you as well as peanut butter and jelly, smushed between two slices of bread to make the best sandwich known to mankind? Whose appearance beside you is as welcome as bacon and eggs on your breakfast plate? Every day? Two who are so close belong together as surely as ""smitten little mittens"". There\'s just no separating them without their names sounding strange. ""Peanut butter and...""? ""A special fork and...""? Without their other half, they don\'t make sense. When you find yourself in the company of one you\'re drawn to ""Like a pencil is drawn to paper"", you know you\'ve got it made. There\'s nothing sweeter than being the other half of one you like so much, and who likes you just as much in return. \n I\'ll read anything by Joyce Wan. Her books are short and make their point abundantly clear, and are ideal for starting pre-readers on a lifetime of getting to know themselves better through the best that literature has to offer. I do believe We Belong Together is the sort of book that will fondly be passed down from generation to generation, and enjoyed by all alike.', ""I can't get over how happy this book made me.

Read betwixt the lines and you might find as I have how kid stars are subjected to offers of the world at their feet, especially if that kid is the main character, and the main draw. That kid, sadly, was young Zachary Gordon, 12 when the shit hit the fans (all of us who have loved the books) and now it\'d be a miracle if he got work in film at all. He was given the biggest trailer truck on the movie lot while certain other actors suffered with smaller ones. AND he was made to wear underwear on camera...frequently! His co-star, hefty little Robert Capron, who plays the lovable sheltered boy Rowley Jefferson, was made to wear a satin disco shirt and smooched on either cheek by well-endowed 20-ish women. Zoo-wee mama indeed! I say this with all the sarcasm and inner hurt at my command, since I saw two of the films...and have paid with my soul ever since, especially considering the appearance of beautiful 13-year-old Chloe Grace Moretz, whom every cigar-chomping exec noticed --big time, and has done numerous R-rated films ever since--BEFORE she turns 18 in a few months. How sad that kids on film should be so hurt by the corrupt film industry in a film that otherwise would\'ve given joy to a lot of people, and I would rather think in some small way it has, since the films are funny and charming. But think about it: these are kids, filmed in embarrassing situations wherein they are seen not as actors or as human, but as property for 40-something male fans in the back row of the theater to salivate over, and it feels wrong to me, as I have two nephews I dearly love, one, 12-year-young Eli, introduced me to the Wimpy Kid Diaries when I needed them most. Eli is a blessing, so to him go my prayers and my thanks. I wish Zach Gordon was as loved as I do Eli. Or Chloe for that matter. God bless the children!']",3.0,,,,

It\'s a great thing that at least Marvel saved one of its better characters for the obviously more talented writers. The story all makes sense, and Gambit and Rogue\'s tussle throughout this volume are highly entertaining. I would highly recommend Gambit to readers who are fans of the ""cooler"" X-Men, and fans of the character in general.', ""This is incredible. It's hilarious, smart, sweet, and infuriating all at once. Gambit has such a heart of gold, but is always looking for trouble. That tendency is beautifully (and maddeningly) played out in his relationship with women, as he tries to help because he truly cares, but is a patronizing, sexist, MAN about it. \n Also, there was so much Rogue in this! It makes me SO happy! They're SO cute, and they have so much history, and they love each other SO much. Even if they're not IN love (which I refuse to believe), they still love each other so much. \n UG I love this book."", ""I really wish this series would stop with the one-shots. \n The contiguous story is really grabbing me, and I'm enjoying the ride unabashedly. But when we get things like this evolutionary city (and yeah, I know there were aspects of that affecting the overall plot but come ON) it just throws an anchor off the side of the storytelling and just hauls everything to a halt. \n Joelle isn't a bad character, but once they explain what her deal is, I really wish we could do more with her. However, I guess that's comics - if you're not the title character, odds are good you do your scenes and then you bow out never to be heard from again. \n Tombstone made for an interesting bad guy in this arc, and the arrival of Rogue was a welcome addition. Overall, I like this less than the first, but still a good addition to any Gambit collection."", 'You know how when Matt Fraction started writing Hawkeye everyone was like, ""Oh man I don\'t care if you like Hawkeye or not, you should definitely check this out??"" This is like the opposite of that, I would only recommend it if you really like Gambit. Which I do, so, OK. It wasn\'t really as fun as the first volume, though. It got a little bogged down with some ~ethical quandaries~ that weren\'t even really a thing? \n However, the Gambit/Hawkeye oneshot at the end is like 5 stars alone just for Gambit calling Hawkeye ""Katniss.""', 'Nothing special.

The volume is mostly one-shot adventures but all connected to the bigger story of Gambit trying to help (and sometimes being betrayed by) Joelle. \n My favorite story was the second issue in the volume; set in ""The Club With No Name"" and featuring a whole bunch of super villains. There\'s even a great line about ""a bad \'90s flashback"" which made me laugh out loud. \n Tremendous fun and a pleasant surprise for a character I didn\'t particularly care about before.', ""This comic is fun, light hearted and playful..... but thats it, at least for me. Never really was a big fan of Gambit, so I am missing some of it all that some of my friends are getting out of it. The appearance of Rogue helped bring back some of the nostalgia I have from reading X-Men in the 90's, but not enough to carry the book for me. \n If you are a Gambit fan, completely recommended to you, but its not a bad comic overall either."", 'A hero playing the shining - armor knight... never saw that before....', ""Now that the novelty of Adorbs Remy has worn off a little, I'm more in like than love with the series.

I also really enjoyed the references back to old school Remy and his ridiculous outfit. It served for a nice laugh during the serious parts. \n I really love the art style. It is probably one of my favorite parts about this run. I think the story tends to drift from what I think the central theme is, but it manages to wind up back to where it was initially going. \n All in all, this was great. I can't wait to pick up volume 3!"", ""Poor Gambit. Nobody takes him seriously, not even the authors of his story. \n I have and always will love Remy, but I wish more was done to develop his character. Unfortunately, it didn't happen here. \n He is all over the place in this novel, running around with no direction and getting into all sorts of trouble. First he plays the ardent anti-hero determined to save the damsel in distress (whether she wants his help or not). Then his angry ex shows up to mess with his mind. \n Fans of the thief will be happy to have a whole novel dedicated to Remy, but if you are just looking to sink your teeth into a good story, then skip this one. \n This is a story of Remy going off on his own to raise hell. It's a fun ride, but there really is no point to this novel. Gambit doesn't know what he wants or who he loves and his frustration carries to the reader. He is taking a break from the x-men, but doesn't want to cross the judicial line and return to being a criminal. He is determined to save a woman that wants nothing to do with him.

(Kindle Locations 897-898). \n Arara doesn\'t want to go to school where she\'s bullied and belittled by the confident and large alpha pup, Kerka and his followers. Arara has a special ability to hear others\' thoughts, but that won\'t help her win any fights. Until she finds out she has another special power, she does everything she can to avoid going to school, but she could use a lesson or two in paying attention and following directions. \n It\'s so interesting to see a society where fighting is not only allowed, but encouraged. Since this is a society that is based on dogs/wolves, this makes sense, since alphas must establish themselves and everyone knows their place in the pack. Not so with underdog Arara. Though she is destined to be an omega, she wants to be an alpha-guard. The only hope she has to win such a high placement in the pack is through her newly discovered ability to use her mind. \n Arara is hard to like at the beginning of the story. She\'s impulsive, scared, reckless and can\'t get her act together. She doesn\'t listen or follow directions, even from her father whom she loves. She whines and ultimately acts like a very young pup. Cue the lesson, which she ignores because of her own stubbornness. She won\'t take bullying sitting down, but she knows she can\'t beat the bigger, stronger, and arrogant Kerka. But will getting back at him make her feel better? Will it solve all her problems? Arara has to learn the hard way that anyone can be a bully and that it\'s not best to get revenge. I loved how Arara was able to finally take the lesson of the story to heart by the end of this novella. \n Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book from the author and this is an honest review.', ""This story was good and engaging. \n Some minor editing things that could have been avoided (word choices and the like) but nothing that could have taken you out of the story. The characters were real, the story engaging and it's part of a longer story that the author wrote. This story is good enough for both young adults and older adults to enjoy.""]",2.0,,,,

For me, it's not a story that engaged me."", ""The Smuggler's Gambit \n Sara Whitford \n Reviewed by Author Roy Murry \n This first book of the Adam Fletcher Adventures I picked from a list because I like the word Gambit. Those who play chess know the importance of planning one's moves (Gambit) before playing and changing it to your advantages to produce the result desired, that being to win the game. \n In Smuggler's Gambit, Adam is a young man full piss and vinegar, seventeen, who gets in trouble with the law defending his mother's honor. Forced into an apprenticeship, he becomes a pawn in a game he is too young to understand, smuggling. \n A criminal minded man, who makes the first move, using his popularity posture, leads Adam into a deadly game of life. His ward is a respectable smuggler, considering the historical period before the American Revolution when the King's subjects disliked his taxes in which the story evolves. \n Adam's resolves his confusion between the two men and makes an unorthodox move that gives the upper hand to the criminals. Through ingenuity, Adam's near-death experience after a happenstance with those undesirables is his last adventurous move that gives him and his new family a checkmate. \n The game was played well by Adam with little experience in such matters. The Smuggler's Gambit is a must read to start the series."", 'An interesting setting, well-developed characters, and enough twists in the storyline to keep me guessing made this an easy and highly enjoyable read.', 'Good for a YA mystery read.', ""The Smuggler's Gambit by Sara Whitford is about seventeen-year-old Adam Fletcher and his journey from tavern server to shopping apprentice. On his path, Adam discovers his small town is filled with more intrigue and illegal activity than he could ever imagine. With the help of his new master, Emmanuel Rogers and his new friends to navigate the treacherous line between good citizen of the Crown during pre-Revolution America and smuggler. When Rogers' direct competition approaches Adam to act as his spy, Adam is torn between loyalty to his employer and the desire to help the wealthy man that he admires. \n Sara Whitford uses The Smuggler's Gambit as a fictional device to teach preteens and teens about life in colonial times in Port Beaufort, North Carolina. Her historical depiction is combined with modern day dialogue to help youthful readers learn while enjoying the story. From political unrest to survival techniques and cask construction, The Smuggler's Gambit is filled with opportunities to challenge inquisitive minds. Her characters are adolescent safe while still being interesting. Her characters have diverse outlooks on life and promote trust among friends and family. While the unrest between the British and the Americans is touched upon, Whitford wisely avoids taking the focus off the story of Adam to demonize the British. \n While I would have enjoyed more suspense during the early chapters of The Smuggler's Gambit, Sara Whitford makes wise use of the later chapters to pack in tons of plot movement. Whitford has a real talent for creating dynamic characters that are easy to commiserate with. Of all the characters, I enjoyed Emmanuel Rogers the most. An old man with a long history ranging from pirate to trusted businessman, he has high ethics and a self confidence that allows him to teach by example the kind of values a young man needs to learn to evolve from impetuous teen to successful businessman. I also admired how a single woman in colonial times had to fight to maintain control of her own child against the disapproval of the town leaders. I recommend The Smuggler's Gambit to teens and preteens who enjoy historical fiction or who have an interest in ships and seaport commerce. If The Smuggler's Gambit is a sample of what new writer Sara Whitford has to offer the young adult reader, I look forward to seeing much more from her. \n ***Originally written for Readers' Favorite***""]",8.0,,,,

She can't believe her luck when she stumbles into a real-life murder scene <i>and</i> her hero, the famous journalist Maude Collier. The story of how Isabel fights to defend the honor of her accused friend and latches on to the murder case makes for a winning middle grade mystery.",isabel-feeney-star-reporter,"['Isabel Feeney is a grubby little newsie in Prohibition Era Chicago. She\'s poor, cold, and struggling, but she\'s plucky, so you know everything is going to turn out okay. On a windy night, she hears a gunshot and finds a dead body. It\'s the fiancee of one her nice customers, who just couldn\'t be a merry murderess, could she? When the press and the popo show up to investigate, Isabel decides she\'ll solve the case and write about it, like her favorite reporter, Maude Collier, who is like Christine Baranski\'s character in Chicago \n The book\'s plot picks up fast. All the above happens in less than sixty pages. However, the characters are predictable and the writing lacks the zingy bite of a Chicago winter. Characterizations are trite. Isabel wears her dead dad\'s hand-me-down clothes, signifying how poor she is. Her hair is a mess! And worse -- it\'s brown, the bane of mousy girls everywhere. Her house is also messy, furniture doesn\'t match, etc. No unique personality. \n Chapters almost always end on cliffhangers, which is also predictable. It also prevents chapters from closing on emotional beats, which would have helped emphasize the grittiness of 1920s Chicago. Lacking emotion, the story feels safe. A young girl witnesses a murder, but there is no sense of danger. \n If the Chicago of that era were a playground with sharp edges, a hot metal slide, and jagged rocks, this book is the rubber coating over anything that seems remotely harmful. It\'s a Chicago without vice, without danger, without jazz. \n The book features a statistical anomaly -- a female newsie who wants to be a writer. As Maude tells Isabel, female writers -- who don\'t cover fashion -- are rare at that time. But it\'s 2017! Simply having a ""strong female protagonist"" isn\'t enough. Just over the past few months, I read some fantastic books for this age group with complex, layered girl heroes. This book, sadly, feels like a book that talks down to kids. This pair of sentences did me in: ""He looked about as happy to see me as I was to see him. Which wasn\'t happy at all."" \n Wow. Thanks for explaining. \n I flipped to the end, which was just as I expected -- safe, predictable, jazzless.']",1.0,,,,
